### Summary
This poster announces an online workshop titled "Generative AI Agent 101" led by Dr. Simon Wang for HKBU students, staff, and external university members. It provides the date, time, and a clear call-to-action to register via a button or QR code, noting that CCL credits are available.

### Suggestions

**Design & Layout**
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is good, but the "Online workshop" tagline is too small and gets lost. Consider making it larger or integrating it more prominently with the title (e.g., as a subtitle).
*   **Speaker Section:** The photo and details are a bit cramped. Increase the gap between the photo and text, or make the photo slightly larger to balance the section. The audience information feels tacked on at the end of the speaker details; it should be its own distinct section or integrated better.
*   **"When" Section:** The blue left border is a nice touch, but the section feels a bit disconnected. Consider adding a small icon (like a calendar or clock) to make it more visually engaging.
*   **Color Contrast:** The green color for "CCL credits available" is a bit jarring against the blue/dark theme. A lighter blue or a gold/yellow accent might integrate better while still standing out.
*   **QR Code:** The QR code is quite large. It could be slightly smaller, and the "Scan to open..." text could be more concise.

**Copy & Clarity**
*   **Title:** "Generative AI Agent 101" is functional but a bit dry. A more engaging title could attract a broader audience.
*   **Tagline:** "Online workshop" is a format, not a value proposition. A tagline that hints at what participants will learn or achieve would be more compelling.
*   **Audience:** The audience description is wordy ("For HKBU students and staff, and students and staff from other universities"). It can be simplified.
*   **CCL Credits:** "CCL credits available." is passive. Make it more active and exciting.
