# Generative AI Agent Student Ambassador Program 2026

This program is designed for both undergraduate and research students, organized by Dr. Simon Wang.

## New Technology
This program provides access to the AI agent within an integrated development environment (IDE), specifically in VS Code. Unlike traditional AI chat tools, this integration enhances user experience by offering seamless functionality, direct code assistance, and context-aware suggestions. The benefits for coursework and research are significant, allowing students to complete what normally requires 3 hours of work in just 30 minutes.

## Program Objectives
The intention of the program is to spread knowledge and empower students through hands-on learning and access to cutting-edge technology. We introduce the concept of three levels of mastery, starting with Level 1, making this an open invitation for interested students to take the steps to join.

## Suitable Ambassadors
We encourage students from both programming and non-programming backgrounds to apply. This includes those in STEM fields as well as non-STEM disciplines such as journalism and humanities, all of whom are interested in learning to program and engage with modern AI tools.

## Steps to Join
1. Sign up for GitHub using a student email.
2. Apply for GitHub’s student benefits.
