# Level 1: Document Processing with AI

## Why this approach helps you

- **Learn by doing**: Step-by-step tutorials and hands-on exercises so you can use AI for real document tasks.
- **Practice on real materials**: Sample documents (PDFs, text) and example workflows you can reuse.
- **Check your progress**: Quizzes and tasks so you know when you've got it.

Level 1 focuses on **document processing with AI** - summarising, extracting, and organising information from documents - a skill you'll use in many courses and projects.
