**Open to:** All undergraduates and research students at HKBU  
**First round:** We aim to recruit **50 undergraduates** and **10 research students**.

**Event period:** Mid Feb to Late Mar  
**Hosted by:** Dr Simon Wang, Lecturer and Innovation Officer, The Language Centre, HKBU

## Why this tech is better than a chatbot

- **No more context switching** – The AI agent works inside your project.
- **Project context** – It can talk to you in the context of your files and repo.
- **Acts on your machine** – It can change files and folders (no copy-paste).
- **Multi-step and multi-file** – It can work across many files and steps.
- **Code without coding** – It can write code for you while you learn.
