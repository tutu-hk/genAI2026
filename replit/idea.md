We wish to introduce IDE and AI agent to HKBU students 
each participant of the programme will apply for a GitHub education account and receive basic training 
then they can run a workshop for 5-10 students to complete the same training 
this can go viral
then we have level 2, 3 training 

they will learn to use AI agent 
- to process docs (level 1)
- call API to use LLM (level 2)
- leverage GitHub projects to support their learning
