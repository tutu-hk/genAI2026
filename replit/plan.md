# GenAI 2026 Programme Plan

## Vision
Introduce IDE and AI agents to HKBU students through a viral, peer-led training model.

## Programme Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Recruit initial cohort of participants
- [ ] Help participants apply for GitHub Education accounts
- [ ] Deliver Level 1 basic training to initial cohort

### Phase 2: Viral Expansion (Weeks 3-6)
