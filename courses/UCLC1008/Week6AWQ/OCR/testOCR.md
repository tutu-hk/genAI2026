given the input courses/UCLC1008/Week6AWQ/OCR/testHandwritten01.jpg
write python scripts to OCR the handwritten notes; tell if a piece of texts are striken out; if so, skip 
use AI power to process the OCR if needed 
create process.log and update in real time the progres
output typed01.md 

=========== the approach does not work =========  

let's use HKBU API key 
when run the script the user will be asked to provide HKBU Gen AI key 
available via https://genai.hkbu.edu.hk/settings/api-docs 
refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/reference?view=foundry-classic
send the images to the LLM to process and return plain texts 
try this and update python file and run it
