when we prepare for a test or take a test, we should consider the input-process-output model 

For test prep 

input: gather all the info about the tests; materials from the course; notes taken during lectures; exercises and tasks done and feedback from teachers (if any) 

Process: consider all the input and gain insights about the test and what I am expected to do during the test; also a plan on how to practice and prepare 

output: different tasks and plans 

once we have this info and set it up we can then work on them using our own brain or getting some help from AI
