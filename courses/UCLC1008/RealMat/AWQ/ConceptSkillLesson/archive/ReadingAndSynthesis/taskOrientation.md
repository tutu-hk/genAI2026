# Task orientation: Academic Writing Quiz (AWQ)

**Purpose:** Ten facts about the quiz with sources, actionable insights, and how to practice.  
**Quiz:** UCLC1008, 27 Feb 2026 (50 min, ≤300 words). Topic: *The impact of AI chatbots and companion apps on humans* (two excerpts from Ho et al. 2025 reference list).

## 1. Time and word limit

**Fact:** The in-class quiz has a **50-minute** time limit and the summary must be **no more than 300 words**.

**Source:** Academic Writing Quiz Instructions (Answer Sheet), Point 4; Sample Academic Writing Quiz instructions.

**Actionable insights:** Plan roughly: reading + note-taking ~15–20 min, drafting ~20–25 min, checking citations and word count ~5–10 min. Aim for ~250–300 words so you stay under the cap without rushing the conclusion.

**How to practice:** Do at least one timed 50-minute practice using the Sample AWQ (FRT in schools) or Module 2 handout (Part 5). Use a timer and count words at the end.

---

## 2. Task type: summarise, paraphrase, synthesise (two excerpts)

**Fact:** You must **summarise, paraphrase and synthesise** the main claims or arguments from **TWO** academic journal excerpts (Articles A and B). You must **not** include your own views or directly copy sentences; write in your own words.

**Source:** Sample Academic Writing Quiz, Instructions 2; Academic Writing Quiz Instructions, Point 4; context.md (topic wording).

**Actionable insights:** Summarise = capture main claims; paraphrase = reword every sentence; synthesise = compare/contrast or group the two authors’ ideas (e.g. by theme), not “Article A says… then Article B says…” in isolation.

**How to practice:** From any two short academic excerpts, write one paragraph that synthesises (e.g. “Scholars disagree on X: Author A argues… whereas Author B contends…”). Then check you used no copied phrases and no “I think”.

---

## 3. APA in-text citations (7th); no abstract, no reference list

**Fact:** You must use **APA in-text citations (7th edition)** to acknowledge ideas. The **abstract must NOT be cited** (it only contextualises the excerpt). **End-of-text reference list is NOT required.**

**Source:** Sample Academic Writing Quiz, Instruction 3; Academic Writing Quiz Instructions, Points 6–7.

**Actionable insights:** Use author-prominent (“Hong et al. (2022) report…”), signal-phrase (“According to Hong et al. (2022),…”), or information-prominent (“…in schools (Hong et al., 2022).”). Use “&” in parentheses, “and” in running text. Never cite the abstract.

**How to practice:** From one paragraph of an article, write three versions of the same claim using the three citation styles. Check APA 7 for multiple authors and secondary citations if needed.

---

## 4. Required structure: introduction, body, conclusion

**Fact:** The summary must be in **paragraph form** with: **Introduction** (background + thesis statement), **Body paragraph(s)** (each with a topic sentence), and **Conclusion**.

**Source:** Sample Academic Writing Quiz, Instruction 4; Academic Writing Quiz Instructions, Point 5; Study Guide Part 2.

**Actionable insights:** Introduction = set the scene + one-sentence preview of the two excerpts’ main findings/arguments. Body = topic sentence(s) that synthesise (e.g. by theme or by contrast), then explanations with citations. Conclusion = short recap, no new ideas.

**How to practice:** Outline a 3–4 paragraph plan (intro, 1–2 body, conclusion) before writing. Use the Study Guide table for “Paragraph 1: Introduction” and “Paragraph 2: Body” and “Paragraph 3: Conclusion”.

---

## 5. No online or AI tools during the test

**Fact:** You are **not** allowed to use any **online or AI tools** (including online dictionaries, paraphrasing or translation apps) during the test.

**Source:** Sample Academic Writing Quiz, Instruction 5; Academic Writing Quiz Instructions, Point 8.

**Actionable insights:** All practice before the test should be done without AI/paraphrasing tools so you build speed and wording skills. Use a paper dictionary only if the invigilator allows it (confirm with teacher).

**How to practice:** Do at least one full timed practice with no phone, no browser, no AI—only question paper, answer sheet, and permitted materials.

---

## 6. Glossary is for reference only; no definitions required in your summary

**Fact:** A **glossary** is provided at the end of the excerpts for specialised terms (underlined in the text). You may consult it for clarification. You are **not** required to include definitions of these terms in your writing.

**Source:** Sample Academic Writing Quiz, Note after Instruction 5; Academic Writing Quiz Instructions, Point 9.

**Actionable insights:** Use the glossary to understand the excerpts, but don’t waste words or time defining terms in your summary unless the task explicitly asks for it.

**How to practice:** When reading sample excerpts, skim the glossary once, then focus on identifying main claims and structure rather than explaining jargon.

---

## 7. Quiz topic and source of excerpts (27 Feb)

**Fact:** The **topic** is *The impact of AI chatbots and companion apps on humans*. The **excerpts are from two articles** in the **reference list of Ho et al. (2025)** “Potential and Pitfalls of Romantic AI Companions: A Systematic Review” (Computers in Human Behavior Reports). The review includes 23 articles (marked with *); the quiz uses two of them.

**Source:** context.md; focusReading.md; Ho2025.md / Sciencedirect reference.

**Actionable insights:** Read Ho et al. (2025) for context. Prioritise the **top 5** articles in focusReading.md (Skjuve et al. 2021, Xie & Pentina 2022, Xie et al. 2023, Li & Zhang 2024, Laestadius et al. 2022) as the most likely sources of excerpts.

**How to practice:** Read Ho et al. (2025) abstract and reference section; read at least the abstracts and key findings of the top 5 articles. Practise identifying “main claims” and “stance” (support / doubt / challenge) from those papers.

---

## 8. How to read excerpts: title → abstract → headings → topic/concluding sentences

**Fact:** The Study Guide teaches a **four-step** reading strategy: (1) Analyse the **title** (subject, context, stance); (2) Study the **abstract** (background, purpose, key findings/implications; skip methods); (3) Examine **section headings**; (4) Identify **topic and concluding sentences**, distinguish **author’s claims** vs **opponents’ claims**, focus on **explanations** and omit detailed evidence/data.

**Source:** Study Guide to Academic Writing Quiz, Part 1 (Steps 1–4).

**Actionable insights:** In the exam, quickly note each excerpt’s stance (e.g. support vs doubt). Use topic sentences to anchor your synthesis; don’t waste words on raw data or long examples.

**How to practice:** Apply the four steps to the Sample AWQ (Articles A and B) and to one article from the top 5 list. Write one-sentence “stance” and “main claim” for each.

---

## 9. What makes a strong vs weak summary (sample scripts)

**Fact:** The **sample student scripts** show a higher-scoring response (Student A: 80/100, 201 words) with clear thesis, synthesis in the topic sentence, accurate citations, and reworded ideas; and a lower-scoring response (Student B: 61/100, 257 words) with vague thesis, article-by-article focus without synthesis, unnecessary data, copied phrases, informal language, and personal views.

**Source:** Sample Academic Writing Quiz (Student_Answer).md.

**Actionable insights:** Avoid “Article A says… Article B says…”; instead, synthesise by theme (e.g. “Scholars disagree on X. Hong et al. argue… whereas Andrejevic and Selwyn contend…”). Omit specific statistics unless they are the main claim. Use formal, academic phrasing and never add “I think” or “maybe”.

**How to practice:** Compare Student A and Student B paragraph by paragraph; then rewrite one paragraph of Student B in a synthesised, formal style and check word count and citations.

---

## 10. Assessment weight and answer sheet rules

**Fact:** The quiz counts for **15%** of the course. You must write **full name (English), student number, and section** on the answer sheet (Pages 2 and 4). Use **pen or pencil** and **write on every line** in the space provided (Pages 2–4).

**Source:** Academic Writing Quiz Instructions (Answer Sheet), Points 1–2; header “IN-CLASS ACADEMIC WRITING QUIZ (15%)”.

**Actionable insights:** Arrive with correct section number and student ID. Use the full writing space and every line to avoid cramming or running out of space; 300 words fits if you write clearly and plan paragraphs.

**How to practice:** Print or mimic the answer sheet layout and do one full practice in the same space (write on every line) so you know how much you can fit per paragraph.

## Discussion questions for teacher and peers

Use these to clarify expectations and share strategies before the quiz.

### With your teacher

1. Can we use a paper (print) dictionary during the quiz, or only the glossary in the paper?  
2. If we are unsure whether a sentence is from the abstract or the main text, should we avoid citing it to be safe?  
3. For the 27 Feb quiz, will the two excerpts always be from different “stances” (e.g. one more supportive, one more critical), or could both be similar?  
4. Is there a minimum word count, or is it only “no more than 300 words”?  
5. How strict is the 50-minute cutoff—e.g. do we have to stop mid-sentence when time is called?

### With peers

1. How are you dividing the 50 minutes (reading vs writing vs checking)?  
2. What’s your strategy for staying under 300 words—writing a short conclusion first, or cutting details from the body?  
3. Which of the top 5 articles (from focusReading.md) have you read, and what one-sentence “main claim” would you give for each?  
4. When you synthesise, do you prefer one body paragraph comparing both articles, or two body paragraphs (one per theme) that bring in both authors?  
5. How do you practise citation under time pressure—e.g. do you write “(Author, year)” as you go or add citations in a final pass?
