I am teaching the course and helping students who need to take an Academic Writing Quiz 3 weeks later
today is 3 Feb and the quiz for my students (section 53) will be held on 27 Feb

students need help to prepare for the quiz 

we have the materials available including 

courses/UCLC1008/lessons/Mat/UCLC1008_2526a_Sample_AWQ_Student.md

this is the sample AWQ 

we also know the topic of the AWQ 

```
You are required to summarise, paraphrase, and synthesise the main claims or arguments from TWO journal article excerpts on the topic "The impact of AI chatbots and companion apps on humans" in NO MORE THAN 300 words.
To prepare for the test, please read:
AWQ Instructions for Students (the cover page of the answer sheet)
a review article entitled "Potential and Pitfalls of Romantic Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companions: A Systematic Review" by Ho et al. (2025). The excerpts included in the test papers are drawn from articles listed in the reference section of this review article.
Both documents are available on Moodle [Individual Section > Academic Writing Quiz (15%)]
The test paper used in Semester 1 has been incorporated into the Module 2 handout (Part 5, pp. 50–60) for practice purposes.
```


so based on the info above 

we already know the excerpts come from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307
