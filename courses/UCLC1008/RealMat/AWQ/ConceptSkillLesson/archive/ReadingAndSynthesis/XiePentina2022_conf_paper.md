## Key findings (from Ho et al. 2025)

Xie & Pentina (2022) showed that **under conditions of distress and lack of human companionship, individuals can develop an attachment to social chatbots** if they perceive the chatbots' responses to offer emotional support, encouragement, and psychological security. These findings suggest that **social chatbots can be used for mental health and therapeutic purposes** but **have the potential to cause addiction and harm real-life intimate relationships**.

## Why likely in quiz (focusReading.md)

Core framing (attachment theory); emotional support, addiction, harm to real relationships; key for “impact on humans.”
