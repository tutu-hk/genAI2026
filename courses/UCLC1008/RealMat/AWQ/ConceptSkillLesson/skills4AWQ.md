# Skills for the Academic Writing Quiz (AWQ)

**Quick reference:** techniques and demos for the in-class summary task (two excerpts, ≤300 words, 50 min).  
Full lesson materials are in **archive/** if you need them.

---

## 1. Task in one sentence

Summarise, paraphrase, and synthesise the main claims from **two** academic excerpts in your own words, with APA in-text citations—**no** personal views, **no** copied sentences.

---

## 2. Reading the excerpts (four steps)

Do this **before** drafting so you have a clear mental map.

| Step | What to do |
|------|------------|
| **1. Title** | Note **subject**, **context**, and **stance**. Keywords: *supporting / benefits* → supportive; *concerns / critical / questions* → critical; *analysis / study* → neutral. |
| **2. Abstract** | Identify **background**, **purpose**, and **key findings or arguments**. Skip method details. **Do not cite the abstract** in your summary. |
| **3. Section headings** | See how the argument is structured (main points and sub-points). |
| **4. Topic and concluding sentences** | Use these as anchors for main claims. Separate **author’s claims** from **opponents’ views** or examples. Omit raw data and long examples. |

**Takeaway:** Do not read word-for-word first. Scan title and abstract to see what each excerpt is about and which side the author is on.

## 3. Summarising: what to keep and what to cut

- **Keep:** Main argument/stance, key claims (reasons for the stance), topic sentences.
- **Cut:** Specific statistics, method details (e.g. sample size, analysis type), minor examples, repetitive phrasing.

**Rule:** Omit detailed evidence/data; they do not replace the stance.

**Technique — “Delete” method:**  
(1) Read the paragraph. (2) Cross out specific numbers, dates, place names. (3) Cross out filler adjectives. (4) What is left is your summary core.

**Neutrality:** Report *what the author said*, not what you think.  
Avoid: *I think…*, *Interestingly…*, *Unfortunately…*.  
Use: *The author states…*, *The study found…*, *It is argued that…*.

---

## 4. Paraphrasing (avoiding plagiarism)

- **Reword every sentence** you use from the sources—change wording and often sentence structure.
- **Strategies:** Synonyms, change word form (e.g. noun → verb), change voice (active ↔ passive).
- **Always cite** the source when you use an idea, even when paraphrased.

Do **not** copy phrases; do **not** use online/AI paraphrasing tools in the exam.

---

## 5. Synthesising (linking Article A and Article B)

Synthesis = compare, contrast, or group the two authors’ ideas—**not** “Article A says… then Article B says…” in isolation.

**Ways to synthesise:**

- **By theme:** e.g. “Scholars disagree on X. Author A argues… whereas Author B contends…”
- **By contrast:** e.g. “While A focuses on perceived value, B emphasises consent and rights.”
- **By point cluster:** Group related points from both articles in one paragraph (e.g. “On privacy, A reports that parents have concerns but still support use; B argues that data are inescapable and consent is inadequate.”).

**Strong thesis:** State the topic and preview the two perspectives (e.g. “This summary contrasts parents’ support for FRT with critics’ concerns about surveillance and consent.”).

**Weak:** Vague thesis; two separate paragraphs that only describe A then B without linking.

---

## 6. Demo: synthesis structure (two excerpts)

**Scenario:** Article A = supportive of a technology in schools; Article B = critical.

**Introduction**

- **Background:** One sentence on the topic (e.g. adoption of the technology in schools).
- **Thesis:** Two contrasting perspectives—e.g. “A shows stakeholder support despite concerns; B warns about inescapable surveillance and lack of consent.”

**Body (one integrated paragraph is better than A-then-B)**

- **Topic sentence:** e.g. “The debate centres on perceived value versus consent.”
- **Cluster 1 (e.g. privacy/consent):** A’s point (e.g. parents have privacy concerns but still support) + B’s point (e.g. data inescapable, consent inadequate).
- **Cluster 2 (e.g. value vs. choice):** A’s point (e.g. perceived value, intention to continue) + B’s point (e.g. opt-out meaningless, coercion).

**Conclusion**

- Short restatement of the tension (e.g. value vs. rights; different stakeholders). No new information.

---

## 7. Required structure and length

- **Introduction:** Background + thesis statement (preview of both excerpts’ main findings/arguments).
- **Body:** One or two paragraphs, each with a clear topic sentence; synthesise by theme or contrast; support with citations.
- **Conclusion:** Brief recap; no new ideas.
- **Length:** No more than **300 words**. Aim ~250–300. Plan time: reading/notes ~15–20 min, drafting ~20–25 min, checking citations and word count ~5–10 min.

---

## 8. APA in-text citations (7th edition)

- **Author-prominent:** Hong et al. (2022) report that…
- **Signal phrase:** According to Hong et al. (2022),…
- **Information-prominent:** …in schools (Hong et al., 2022).

Use **&** inside parentheses; use **and** in running text. Do **not** cite the abstract.

---

## 9. What to avoid (common errors)

| Avoid | Do instead |
|-------|------------|
| “Article A says… Article B says…” (no synthesis) | Synthesise by theme or contrast in topic sentences. |
| Copying phrases from the excerpts | Paraphrase and cite. |
| Including your views (“I think…”, “Maybe…”) | Report the authors only; stay neutral. |
| Long statistics or method details | Keep only what is needed for the main claim. |
| Citing the abstract | Cite only the main text. |
| Informal language | Use formal, academic phrasing. |

## 10. Prep checklist

- [ ] Do at least one **timed 50-minute** practice (no AI, no online tools).
- [ ] Practise **one** synthesis paragraph from two short excerpts (compare/contrast).
- [ ] Practise **three citation styles** (author-prominent, signal phrase, information-prominent) for the same claim.
- [ ] Outline **intro → body (with topic sentences) → conclusion** before writing.
- [ ] Compare a **higher-scoring** vs **lower-scoring** sample script (see Sample AWQ Student_Answer) to see synthesis and tone.
