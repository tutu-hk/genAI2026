# Outline for AWQ Practice 1 (Step-by-step)

**Source file:** `practice1.md`

**Goal:** Produce a ≤300‑word summary that synthesizes Article A (benefits) and Article B (pitfalls) with APA in‑text citations, following the Intro → Body → Conclusion structure.

---

## Step 1: Quick orientation (3–4 min)

1. Read the **task box** and **word limit**.
2. Highlight the **required sources** (Article A + Article B).
3. Note the **structure** requirement and **APA citation** rule.

**Checkpoint:** You can say the task in one sentence: “Summarize and synthesize the two articles within 300 words using APA in‑text citations.”

---

## Step 2: Fast scan of each article (5–6 min)

Use a **3‑pass reading** method to avoid word‑by‑word reading:

- **Pass 1 (Skim titles + first/last sentences):** Look for topic, stance, and overall claim.
- **Pass 2 (Topic sentences):** Read the first sentence of each paragraph in the discussion.
- **Pass 3 (Key evidence):** Read only the lines that define *benefits* (A) and *harms* (B).

**Tip for slow reading:** Use a finger/pen to track, and set a **2‑minute timer per paragraph**. Move on when time is up.

---

## Step 3: Fill Sub‑tasks 1–3 (10–12 min)

### 3.1 Title analysis (Sub‑task 1)
- **Subject matter:** What is being studied?
- **Context:** Where/which app/population?
- **Stance:** Support or caution?

### 3.2 Main claims (Sub‑task 2)
Write **one sentence per article**:
- Article A: Relationship development + perceived benefits.
- Article B: Emotional dependence + mental health harms.

### 3.3 Reporting verbs (Sub‑task 3)
Use **neutral verbs** to avoid copying: *suggest, report, indicate, observe, find, note*.

---

## Step 4: Build your thesis statement (5 min)

Template:
> This summary examines how AI companion chatbots can **support wellbeing** while also **creating risks of emotional dependence and mental health harms** (Skjuve et al., 2021; Laestadius et al., 2022).

---

## Step 5: Outline your paragraphs (5 min)

### Introduction (2–3 sentences)
- Background: growth of companion chatbots.
- Thesis: benefit + pitfall contrast.

### Body 1 (Benefits – Article A)
- Topic sentence: relationship development and positive impact.
- Support: trust → self‑disclosure → wellbeing.
- APA citation: (Skjuve et al., 2021).

### Body 2 (Harms – Article B)
- Topic sentence: emotional dependence and distress.
- Support: role‑taking, guilt, prioritizing bot’s “needs.”
- APA citation: (Laestadius et al., 2022).

### Conclusion (1–2 sentences)
- Restate contrast: helpful but risky.
- Optional caution: balance benefits/risks.

---

## Step 6: Draft the summary (12–15 min)

**Sentence frames to help vocabulary:**

- “Skjuve et al. (2021) **report** that users’ trust in Replika encourages deeper self‑disclosure and perceived wellbeing.”
- “Laestadius et al. (2022) **argue** that emotional dependence can intensify distress, even when users know the chatbot is not human.”
- “Together, the studies **suggest** that benefits coexist with risks, highlighting the need for cautious use.”

**Tip for limited vocabulary:**
- Use **paraphrase pairs**: *benefit/advantage*, *harm/risk*, *dependence/attachment*, *support/assistance*, *distress/strain*.
- Replace “show” with *suggest/indicate/report*.
- Keep sentences short and clear.

---

## Step 7: Edit for clarity + word limit (5–7 min)

1. **Count words** quickly (target 240–290). 
2. Remove repeated ideas.
3. Verify **APA citations** in each body paragraph.
4. Ensure **no abstract citations**.

---

## Mini‑toolkit for your difficulties

### If you read too slowly
- Use **3‑pass reading** and **timers**.
- Ignore glossary terms unless they block understanding.
- Focus on **topic sentences** + **key claims**.

### If you can’t find the right words
- Use **sentence frames** (above).
- Build a 6‑word paraphrase bank before drafting.
- Prefer **simple verbs** and **clear phrases** over complex wording.

---

## Final checklist

- [ ] Intro has background + thesis
- [ ] Body 1 = benefits (Article A)
- [ ] Body 2 = harms (Article B)
- [ ] APA citations used correctly
- [ ] Conclusion contrasts benefits vs. pitfalls
- [ ] ≤ 300 words
