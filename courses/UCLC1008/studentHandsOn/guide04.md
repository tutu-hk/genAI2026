# Guide 04: Paraphrase one paragraph with AI as a “mirror”

The AWQ requires you to write in **your own words**—no copying. To practise, pick **one paragraph** from an excerpt and ask an AI agent to (1) produce a paraphrase and (2) explain what changed (e.g. synonyms, sentence structure, voice). You then compare and learn what “good paraphrase” looks like. (In the exam you can’t use AI; this is for training your eye.)

**Input:** One paragraph from an academic excerpt. For example, copy one paragraph from:
- `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/AIagentDemo/focusedReading/Laestadius2022.md`  
  or from  
- `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/RealMat/AWQ/ExamTipsPractice/MockPractice/practice1.md`  
  (e.g. one full paragraph from Article A or B)

Paste it into a small file, e.g. `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/studentHandsOn/oneParagraph_toParaphrase.md`.

**Process:** Ask the AI agent to:
1. Read the paragraph.
2. Produce a **paraphrase** that keeps the same meaning but uses different words and sentence structures (no copying of phrases).
3. Add a **short note** (3–5 bullets) on what changed: e.g. “Passive → active”, “Noun → verb”, “Synonyms used: X → Y”.
4. Remind you: in the real AWQ you must do this yourself and cite the author (e.g. Hong et al., 2022).

**Output:** Create a file in the same folder, e.g. `paraphrase_andNotes.md`, containing:
- Original paragraph (or “see oneParagraph_toParaphrase.md”)
- Paraphrased version
- “What changed” bullets
- One sentence: “In the AWQ I would add: (Author, year).”

**Tip:** Try with a paragraph that has **numbers or technical terms** (e.g. “3.919”, “perceived value”)—you’ll see that you can reword the explanation while keeping the finding and citing the source. That’s exactly what the exam expects.

Send the path of this file (and your one-paragraph file) to the AI agent to start.
