# Guide 03: Get feedback on your draft against AWQ criteria

You’ve written a practice summary (under 300 words). Before you hand it in or move on, use an AI agent to **check it against the same criteria** that make Student A strong and Student B weak—synthesis, no copying, structure, citations, formal tone. Think of it as a friendly coach reading your draft once.

**Input:**
1. Your draft (paste it into a `.md` file, e.g. `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/studentHandsOn/myDraft_practice1.md`).
2. The criteria/rubric. Point the AI to:  
   `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/AIagentDemo/taskOrientation.md`  
   especially **item 9** (strong vs weak sample) and **items 2–4** (task type, citations, structure).

**Process:** Ask the AI agent to:
1. Read your draft and the relevant parts of `taskOrientation.md`.
2. Check: Does the intro have **background + thesis**? Do body paragraphs **synthesise** (compare/contrast both articles) rather than “Article A says… Article B says…”?
3. Check: **APA in-text citations** present and correct? No **direct copying**? No **personal views** (“I think”, “maybe”)?
4. Give a short **checklist** (✓ or ✗) and **one or two concrete suggestions** (e.g. “Add a topic sentence that combines both authors” or “Replace this phrase with your own words”).

**Output:** Create a file in the same folder as your draft, e.g. `feedback_myDraft_practice1.md`, with:
- Checklist (structure, synthesis, citations, paraphrasing, tone)
- 1–2 specific improvements
- Optional: word count and a reminder of the 300-word limit

**Tip:** You can do this for the Sample AWQ (FRT) or for Practice 1 (AI chatbots). The agent is not grading you—it’s helping you spot gaps so *you* can revise. In the exam there’s no AI; this builds your self-check habit.

Send the path of this file and your draft file to the AI agent to start.
