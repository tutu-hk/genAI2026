# Guide 05: Build a 50-minute time plan and paragraph outline

You have **50 minutes** and **no more than 300 words**. It’s easy to run out of time or space if you don’t plan. Use an AI agent to create a **time plan** (reading vs writing vs checking) and a **paragraph outline** (intro / body / conclusion) for a specific practice task—so you can rehearse the same routine before the real quiz.

**Input:** Point the AI to:
1. The practice task you’re doing, e.g.  
   `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/RealMat/AWQ/ExamTipsPractice/MockPractice/practice1.md`  
   or the Sample AWQ excerpts (FRT in schools) in your materials.
2. The timing and structure rules:  
   `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/AIagentDemo/taskOrientation.md`  
   (item 1: 50 min, 300 words; item 4: intro, body, conclusion).

**Process:** Ask the AI agent to:
1. Propose a **50-minute split**, e.g. reading + notes 15–20 min, drafting 22–25 min, citations + word count 5–8 min.
2. For the **same practice task**, produce a **paragraph outline** (no full sentences):  
   - Intro: background (1–2 ideas) + thesis (one idea).  
   - Body: topic sentence idea(s), which claims from Article A and B to synthesise, and in what order.  
   - Conclusion: recap idea (no new points).
3. Add **word budget** hints if helpful (e.g. intro ~60, body ~180, conclusion ~50).

**Output:** Create a file in a sensible folder, e.g.  
`genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/studentHandsOn/timePlan_practice1.md`  
(or `timePlan_sampleAWQ.md`), containing:
- 50-minute breakdown (with minutes per phase)
- Paragraph-by-paragraph outline (bullet points only)
- Optional: one-line reminders (e.g. “Check APA before the last 5 min”)

**Tip:** Use this **before** you do a timed practice. On the day, you won’t have AI—but if you’ve already practised this split and outline type, you’ll know how much time to spend reading vs writing. See also `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/AIagentDemo/demo.log` for examples of outline and plan tasks.

Send the path of this file and the practice task path to the AI agent to start.
