# Guide 02: Extract main claims and stance from one excerpt

If you're reading this in VS Code (or Cursor), you can ask an AI agent to help you **analyse one article excerpt** before you write—so you know each author’s main claims and stance (support / doubt / challenge). That’s exactly what the Study Guide’s Step 1–4 ask you to do by hand; doing it once with AI can make the steps clearer.

**Input:** One excerpt file, for example:
- `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/AIagentDemo/focusedReading/Skjuve2021.md`  
  or any of: `XiePentina2022.md`, `Xie2023.md`, `LiZhang2024.md`, `Laestadius2022.md`  
- Or one excerpt section from:  
  `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/RealMat/AWQ/ExamTipsPractice/MockPractice/practice1.md`

**Process:** Ask the AI agent to:
1. Read the excerpt (and abstract if present).
2. Identify: **title → subject matter, context, stance** (support / doubt / challenge / etc.).
3. List **3–5 main claims or key findings** in short bullet form.
4. Note **one or two phrases** from the text that show the author’s stance.

**Output:** Create a short file in the **same folder** as the input (or in `studentHandsOn/` if you prefer), e.g. `claimsStance_Skjuve2021.md`, containing:
- Title analysis (subject, context, stance)
- Main claims (bullets)
- Stance evidence (short quotes)
- Optional: one-sentence “preview” you could use in a thesis statement

**Tip:** Use this for **one** of the top-5 articles from `genAI2026/courses/UCLC1008/AIagentDemo/focusReading.md` so it doubles as quiz prep. In the real exam you can’t use AI—this practice teaches you *what* to look for when you read on your own.

Send the path of this file (or the excerpt you chose) to the AI agent to start.
