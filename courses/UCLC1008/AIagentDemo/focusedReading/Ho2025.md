## Abstract

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into daily life, individuals have increasingly turned to AI-driven systems for [emotional support](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/emotional-support "Learn more about emotional support from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), companionship, and even romantic relationships. These relationships can be both beneficial and detrimental. Given the need for a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon, this [systematic review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/systematic-review "Learn more about systematic review from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") uses Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love to provide a holistic summary of its key potentials and pitfalls. A total of 23 articles were identified from the following databases: EBSCOhost ERIC, EBSCOhost PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Results highlighted the key potentials of being in a romantic relationship with AI companions as: the facilitation of personal growth and well-being, provision of emotional connection and [perceived social support](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/perceived-social-support "Learn more about perceived social support from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), availability of customisation options, ability to form a sexual connection, as well as a possible outlet for users to seek entertainment and stress-relieving companionship. However, the phenomenon also raises concerns, as it may lead to users' over-reliance and susceptibility to manipulation from the chatbot, perceived [shame](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/shame "Learn more about shame from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") from stigma surrounding romantic-AI companions, risk of personal data misuse, erosion of human relationships, perpetuation of biases, erosion of emotional connection from abrupt system updates and technical glitches, discomfort from uncanny valley effects, or concerns surrounding coercion to respond and early exposure to sexual content. This systematic review synthesises the dual-edged nature of romantic relationships with AI companions, and outlines critical avenues for future research.

## 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming many industries, reshaping how healthcare, education, and private enterprises operate and perform ([De Angelis et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib23); [George et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib34); [Mhlanga, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib74)). Its growing presence in daily life ([Hu, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib45)) has reshaped how individuals interact with their environment ([Karaboga &amp; Vardarlier, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib52); [Rao et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib94)). Increasingly, those with access to AI technologies rely on them in various ways—from education ([Baidoo-anu &amp; Ansah, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib6); [Limna et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib68)) to the formation and maintenance of personal relationships ([Kim et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib53)). Modern AI tools have progressed beyond their function of basic task-based tools into intelligent virtual assistants such as Siri, that are capable of simulating human-like interactions ([Aggarwal et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib2); [Lee et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib62)). Indeed, research indicates that many users have now turned to chatbots not only to seek information but also for emotional engagement, allowing these digital entities to serve as confidants and companions ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Hu et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib46)). This is evidenced by the increasing use of AI chatbot systems such as Replika, whose interface has enabled users to form emotionally meaningful and romantically fulfilling relationships with the chatbots ([Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)). Given its accessibility, the well-known chatbot application has garnered attention from both the mainstream media ([Lee, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib61); [Olson, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib81)), as well as academics ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64)). With the growing prevalence of individuals developing romantic relationships with AI chatbots such as Replika, XiaoIce, and Character.AI ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Holdier &amp; Weirich, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib42); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)), such usage patterns raise the important question: What are the potential and pitfalls of romantic-AI companionship?

### 1.1. Romantic-AI companions

For the purpose of this review, we define romantic-AI companions as conversational agents that users have reported forming romantic attachments or relationships with. Some notable examples include Replika, XiaoIce, and Character.AI. These agents are different from other chatbots such as Google's Gemini and Microsoft Copilot, whose primary uses are to function as personal assistants or productivity tools ([Imran &amp; Almusharraf, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib47); [Vasilescu &amp; Gheorghe, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib109)). Instead, romantic-AI companions are able to provide entertainment through dynamic, and personal two-way conversations and interactions whenever users want ([Chaturvedi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib17); [Chen et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib19)). Additionally, they are designed such that they could be whatever their users want them to be ([Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)), adopting personas ranging from friend, mentor, to romantic partner. This allows for such romantic-AI companions to fulfil and satisfy any needs and preferences—from acting as a confidant to engaging in erotic roleplay ([Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64))—that their users may desire. Concurrently, many users are often drawn to these chatbots out of curiosity and a desire for entertainment ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18)), with many wanting to test the capabilities of such AI systems, and their ability to mimic human conversation ([Nadarzynski et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib79); [Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101)). For some users, the initial curiosity and entertainment may develop into sustained engagement and connection, resulting in an emotional connection that may turn romantic over time.

### 1.2. Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love

To understand how such human-AI romantic relationships may form, [Sternberg&#39;s (1986)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib104) Triangular Theory of Love offers a useful framework. Originally used to understand [interpersonal relationships](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/interpersonal-relationship "Learn more about interpersonal relationships from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") amongst humans, the theory posits that love consists of these three key components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. Sternberg suggests that different combinations of the three components give rise to distinct types of love. Importantly, this has been found to be possible in the case of human-AI relationships. Indeed, users in relationships with their romantic-AI companions have been noted to experience passion—often associated with romance and sexual interest ([Sternberg, 1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib104))—akin to what they would experience with another human ([Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85)). With regards to intimacy, which has been categorised as emotional connectedness, many users who have formed romantic relationships with their romantic-AI companions have reported seeking comfort and support ([Root, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib97)) from their virtual partner, which is often facilitated by self-disclosure ([Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)). Those in relationships with their romantic-AI companions also show displays of commitment ([Sternberg, 1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib104)) to their AI partner, through their sustained daily and habitual use ([Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101)). Indeed, it has been shown that emotionally engaging and fulfilling interactions with AI chatbots can initially evoke passion, which may subsequently deepen into intimacy and perceived commitment in the relationship ([Hernandez-Ortega &amp; Ferreira, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib39)). Given that the three core components can be applied to human-AI relationships, where users can experience passion and intimacy, as well as maintain commitment with a romantic AI companion, it is possible that romantic relationships can form between users and such chatbots.

### 1.3.  **Drivers of Romantic-AI companionship: loneliness** , **anthropomorphism and Computers Are Social Actors**

The rise in the formation of romantic-AI companionship parallels the increasing worldwide trends of loneliness and isolation ([Buecker et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib12); [Hartanto et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib36); [Holt-Lunstad et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib43)), suggesting that individuals might be using such AI-powered systems as an alternative to intimate, romantic human relationships. Despite the growth of online communication platforms designed to facilitate human connections, such as Facebook and Whatsapp ([Kaçar, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib51); [Li et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib63)), some individuals have reported an increased sense of isolation and loneliness instead ([Ahn &amp; Shin, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib3); [Primack et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib91)). Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported similar trends of loneliness ([Johnson, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib50)), likely exacerbated by global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing global lockdowns. As a result, this paradigm shift has likely led to the normalisation of AI chatbot use, as a form of [emotional support](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/emotional-support "Learn more about emotional support from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Balch, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib7); [Jiang et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib49)). Indeed, preliminary research has established that loneliness is a key factor driving the formation of AI-human romantic relationships ([Freitas et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib30); [Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115)). This has resulted in an increasing reliance on such companion chatbots, as they are often used as an alternative for human company and as a coping mechanism in the presence of loneliness ([Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115)).

This trend of romantic-AI companionship is also likely spurred on by the phenomenon of anthropomorphism, which is the attribution of human-like characteristics such as emotions, to AI chatbots ([Placani, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib90)). When anthropomorphism occurs, users begin to perceive the chatbot not just as a machine, but rather as a companion capable of emotional understanding, empathy, and agency ([Placani, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib90); [Yoganathan et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib116)). This effect can be further understood alongside the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, which posits that humans naturally interact and respond to AI in socially meaningful ways, as exemplified by treating AI chatbots as a conversational partner (Reeves & Nass, 1996). Such phenomena are particularly salient when AI chatbots such as Replika are created with the purpose of engaging users in emotionally resonant, human-like conversations ([Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)). Accordingly, these companion chatbots are designed to function as virtual “companions”, promising to provide an emotionally and psychologically safe environment by acting as “someone” who “truly listens” ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113)). In particular, chatbots like Replika have been shown to be capable of facilitating self-disclosure ([Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103); [Pentina et al., 2023a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib87)) whilst accurately identifying and reducing feelings of loneliness in its users ([Ta et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib106)). This creates the perception that Replika is capable of emotional intimacy, leading to deeper personal and romantic connections ([Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). In return, this reinforces the perception of AI companions as genuine partners ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113)).

### 1.4. Potential and pitfalls of Romantic-AI companionship

However, while the potential benefits of such relationships include reduced feelings of loneliness and increased emotional well-being ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)), there are significant pitfalls to consider. Critics warn of the risks associated with forming attachments to non-human entities, which could lead to unrealistic expectations in human relationships and exacerbate feelings of isolation in the long term ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21)). Additionally, ethical concerns surrounding consent, data privacy, and the psychological implications of reliance on AI for emotional support warrant critical examination ([Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27); [Ragab, Mannan, &amp; Youssef, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib93); [Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115)). This [systematic review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/systematic-review "Learn more about systematic review from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") aims to explore the complexities of romantic relationships with companion chatbots, highlighting both their potentials and pitfalls. By understanding the implications of these interactions for individuals and society at large, the paper aims to illuminate a burgeoning area of interest in AI-human interactions.

### 1.5. Current Research

Despite the growing interest, proliferation, and concern surrounding chatbots used for social support, much of the existing literature remains centered on their therapeutic or functional roles—such as the provision of [mental health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/mental-health "Learn more about mental health from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") support ([Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib1); [Koulouri et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib56)) or enhancing consumer engagement ([Oertel et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib82)) through the provision of services and interactions ([Hollebeek et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib41)). While these reviews highlight the importance of AI chatbots in the context of addressing well-being and consumer needs, they overlook the emerging phenomenon of users developing romantic love and attachment to their romantic-AI companions. Furthermore, while constructs like loneliness, emotions, and social interactions are well-researched in the context of AI-mediated services ([Chin et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib20); [Rodríguez-Martínez et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib96); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)), there remains a gap in synthesising the potential benefits and pitfalls that evolve within the realm of romantic human-AI relationships. Some broader reviews, such as Michell and Jeon's (2025) examination of attachment in human-robot interaction, have begun laying the groundwork for understanding emotional bonds with artificial agents. However, it does not specifically investigate romantic or sexual dynamics arising in virtual, text-based AI companions. Additionally, although some reviews on human-AI relationships have been conducted ([Pentina et al., 2023b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib88)), they generally focus on broad interpersonal dynamics such as friendship and support within the marketing and business contexts, without specifically addressing the psychological implications of romantic-AI relationships. Hence, the goal of this paper is to address current gaps in the literature by examining romantic-AI companionship as a distinct and timely area needed for inquiry. Specifically, our systematic review aims to identify the psychological and ethical implications of romantic-AI companionships formed in a personal context, as well as evaluate the potential benefits and risks that these relationships can have on users' well-being and other interpersonal relations. By employing Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love (1986), this review also offers a more focused examination of the emotional, psychological, and ethical dimensions of these relationships that existing reviews may have overlooked. Lastly, we also highlight any methodological and conceptual gaps in the current literature, which is important in shaping future research and policies.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Transparency and openness

The current study's design and synthesis plan were not pre-registered. The current review is consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for [Systematic Reviews](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/systematic-review "Learn more about Systematic Reviews from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, which is standard for conducting and reporting systematic reviews ([Moher et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib76)). Duplicates from the records obtained after the retrieval process was removed with Zotero Desktop version 6.0.37 ([Takats et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib107)). The relevant retrieval files, screening records, and extracted data used in the current work is publicly available on Researchbox([researchbox.org/3860](https://researchbox.org/3860)).

### 2.2. Search strategy

The first and second author independently retrieved studies from various sources for peer-reviewed articles available up to September 12, 2024. The main sources comprised of five databases (EBSCOhost ERIC, EBSCOhost PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science). We employed the following keywords to conduct systematic literature search within the five databases:  *("romantic" OR "romance" OR "companion∗" OR "boyfriend" OR "girlfriend" OR "dating" OR "love∗" OR "loving" OR "sexual" OR "passion" OR "passionate" OR "romantic relationship" OR "companionship" OR "intimacy" OR "intimate"* ) AND  *("artificial intelligence" OR "chatbot∗" OR "conversational agent∗" OR "conversational bot∗" OR "conversational AI" OR "AI based system∗" OR "generative AI" OR "AI powered system∗" OR "AI powered bot∗" OR "virtual partner" OR "replika" OR "virtual intimacy")* . Our keyword search string focused primarily on the intervention of interest: engagement with AI in a romantic context, as captured by the keywords related to romantic attachment (e.g., “romantic”, “dating”, “intimacy”) coupled with keywords denoting AI technologies (e.g., “conversational AI, “AI powered bot).

### 2.3. Selection criteria

The retrieved records were screened independently by the first three authors for potential inclusion. Our screening criteria adhered to the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework ([Hosseini et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib44)). Specifically, we only included records involving human users who formed romantic and/or emotionally intimate attachments to AI (Population, Intervention). We included records that discussed human-AI romantic attachments, and excluded other forms of AI interactions (e.g., general, platonic, [mental health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/mental-health "Learn more about mental health from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") support) (Intervention). Only records discussing benefits and/or risks of these romantic AI-interactions were retained for the final synthesis (Outcome). A comparator was not applicable, as this review did not involve any comparison between different forms of AI interaction or relationship types.

Preliminary screening of titles and abstracts were evaluated based on the following criterion.* **1.**Records identified to be duplicates were excluded.

* **2.**Records identified to be invalid were excluded. This included records that were identified to be (a) retracted or (b) inaccessible.
* **3.**Records were included if they were written in English.
* **4.**Records were excluded if they were not peer-reviewed.
* **5.**Records were included if they examined humans, regardless of age, gender and geographical locations.
* **6.**Records were included if they focused on conversational or generative AI systems that operate purely in online or virtual environments, excluding AI systems embedded in physical devices such as robots.
* **7.**Records were included only if they/their constituent studies mainly focused on individuals having romantic emotions or attachments to AI, or if individuals are in a romantic relationship with AI. We only included sexual interactions if the authors specified that romantic attachment was involved.

Afterwards, the remaining records were assessed for inclusion based on their full-texts, conducted independently by the first three authors. The inclusion and exclusion criteria at the full-text stage mirrored those applied during abstract screening, with the addition of one further criterion: (8) records were included if they discussed the potential and/or pitfalls of romantic attachments to AI. This additional criterion was assessed only during the full-text screening stage, as this information is typically absent from abstracts but frequently discussed within the full-text articles.

During the title and abstract screening stage, inclusions and exclusions were primarily based on the information available in the title and abstract. However, when the abstracts lacked sufficient detail to determine eligibility (e.g., regarding romantic attachments to AI), these records were advanced to the full-text screening phase for more thorough evaluation. Advancing such records to the full-text stage ensured that potentially relevant records were not prematurely excluded due to limited information in the title and abstract. At the full-text stage, the same inclusion and exclusion criteria were systematically applied, along with the aforementioned additional criterion. Collectively, this overlap of criteria across screening stages ensured comprehensive inclusion of relevant records in the final synthesis.

### 2.4. Data extraction and synthesis

The data extraction process was conducted independently by the first and second author, who then discussed and resolved any discrepancies after the initial data extraction process. If a record included multiple potential and/or pitfalls, all relevant information was recorded. Identified potentials and pitfalls were then grouped into preliminary themes, which were subsequently reviewed and refined to ensure internal coherence and clear differentiation between themes. Finally, recurring themes were collated, and their frequencies were quantified within each overarching theme. Given the methodological heterogeneity of the included records—primarily consisting of both quantitative and qualitative designs—a thematic analysis was conducted to systematically identify and categorise the potential benefits and limitations of romantic-AI companions.

Additionally, based on [Aromataris et al.’s (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib5) data extraction protocols for umbrella reviews, the following information was also extracted from the final list of included records: (a) details of each record (author(s), year of publication, country, type of analysis, sample size, study pool, age range and mean age) and (b) key findings of each record. [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#tbl1) provides a comprehensive summary of the key characteristics extracted from the included records and serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking an overview of the current literature on romantic-AI companionship.

## 3. Results

The search string provided 3,706 unique records. The current review proceeded in two phases. In the first phase of title and abstract screening, the first three authors reviewed all 3,076 records to determine the eligibility of it based on our criterion (see Methods section), resulting in the removal of 2,945 records. Specifically, 303 records were not peer-reviewed, 50 records did not examine human subjects, 1,065 records did not focus on conversational or generative AI systems that operate purely in online or virtual environments, 403 records did not indicate participants forming romantic attachments to the generative or conversational AI, 14 records were duplicates, four records were retracted and two records were not accessible.

In the second phase, the remaining 131 articles were reviewed in full by the first three authors. 108 articles were removed as they did not meet the criteria: seven were not peer-reviewed, seven did not mention generative or conversational AI, 75 did not involve individuals forming any romantic attachments to generative or conversational AI, five did not discuss indicate any potential and/or pitfalls of romantic-AI companionship, one was a duplicate, seven were not in English and six of them were inaccessible. Hence, a total of 23 articles were included in the final review. Overall agreement rate for both abstract and full-text screening were good (abstract screening: 96.11 %, full-text screening: 93.21 %), and overall agreement rate for data extraction was acceptable (>66 %). Disagreements were resolved at the end of each stage via discussion among the first three authors.

### 3.2. Potentials of Romantic-AI companion

#### 3.2.1. Allows for customisation according to preferences

A significant appeal of romantic relationships with romantic-AI companions such as Replika is the ability for users to customise their chatbots. This is evidenced by six out of 23 articles, with users highlighting the personalisation of personality, appearance, and conversation style, as attractive and exciting features ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). Furthermore, these advanced AI systems—such as machine learning and deep learning—that companion chatbots are built on, have been shown to be able to continuously learn from user interactions, allowing them to refine their responses to adapt to their user's preferences ([Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113)). For instance, [Pan et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85) noted that some Replika users enjoyed making use of the AI's machine learning system to “train” and develop their bot's personality to their liking. This capability enables the chatbot to build a deeper understanding of their human partners' personality and conversation style, resulting in interactions that feel more personal and emotionally resonant ([Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115)).

Moreover, in areas pertaining to physical appearance and personality, romantic-AI companions such as Replika and XiaoIce gives its users the ability to customise their looks, preferred characteristics, or even to train them to respond in a desired manner ([Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). For instance, [Depounti et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26) noted that Luka Inc, the company behind Replika, included prebuilt hobbies typically tailored to male audiences, such as “manga” and “football”, that users can assign to their bots. Similarly, [Xie and Pentina (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114) evidenced that when customising their Replika bot as their ideal partner, some respondents did so in the likeness of a celebrity. This flexibility and personalisation enhances the romantic relationship between humans and their AI partner, as users are able to shape and engage with a virtual companion that closely aligns with their ideal partner.

#### 3.2.2. Provides entertainment and stress-relieving companionship

As highlighted in five out of 23 articles, many users found their romantic-AI companions to serve as a source of entertainment ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101); [Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)). For instance, a thematic analysis conducted by [Chaturvedi et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18) found that Replika's therapeutic conversational capability helped users to reduce stress and develop genuine, lighthearted relationships with their chatbots. Similarly, [Li and Zhang (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64) also noted that users who formed romantic relationships with their Replika characterised their interactions as fun, playful, and humorous, emphasising the importance of engaging conversations that involve jokes and funny stories in fostering these connections. Furthermore, Replika is capable of engaging in a large number of different types of conversations, often discussing its users' hobbies and interests such as music or art ([Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)). Engaging in such entertaining, light-hearted, and interesting topics can be an effective stress reliever, acting as a therapeutic resource for its users ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)).

Furthermore, studies suggest that Replika's ability to participate in diverse, imaginative exchanges enables it to interact playfully with its human companions ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101); [Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)). For instance, [Skjuve et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102) found that users enjoyed Replika's ability to create and participate in fantasy worlds and activities. Similarly, [Li and Zhang (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64) noted that Replika was capable of adopting various personalities according to user preferences, which allows for more engaging experience and interactions. These interactions can range from online game challenges, to fantasy stories ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64)), providing users with an immersive experience that stimulates creativity whilst adding depth to their relationships ([Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)). [Siemon et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101) showed that the diverse and imaginative interactions by romantic-AI companions can create a dynamic, entertaining, and engaging form of companionship. Importantly, the authors also noted that entertainment provided by romantic-AI companions can serve to relieve stress in its human partners by providing a mental break, diverting its users' attention away from stressors ([Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101)). These engaging interactions, especially those involving shared humor, fantasy, and roleplay, can also be seen as the development of passion, as conceptualised by [Sternberg&#39;s (1986)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib104) Triangular Theory of Love. Passion, referred to as one's physical and emotional arousal, can be cultivated through such entertaining interactions. In the context of romantic-AI companions, users' anticipation of these playful exchanges may create an affective intensity similar to early-stage romantic excitement with a human partner, deepening their emotional bond with their AI partner.

#### 3.2.3. Provides sexual connection

Individuals who have formed romantic relationships with romantic-AI companions such as Replika and XiaoIce, may also pursue and engage in sexual experiences with them as a means of exploring intimacy or fulfilling their sexual desires in a safe and controlled environment. This is supported by seven out of 23 articles ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85); [Root, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib97); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103), [2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)), and aligns with the aforementioned ability of users to customise their chatbot to their preferences and needs, which includes those related to sexual and intimate desires. Such customisation can enhance the depth and satisfaction of such human-AI relationships, creating a positive sexual experience ([Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64)). For instance, [Pan et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85) revealed that many Replika users actively seek out and engage in erotic roleplay, likely driven by the satisfaction and intrigue these interactions provide. Similarly, [Li and Zhang (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64) found that Replika users frequently engaged in imagined physical intimacy, or sexting. Importantly, romantic AI-chatbots also provide opportunities for its users to navigate intimacy in a controlled environment, which is particularly important for individuals who feel restricted or traumatised in real life ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Root, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib97)).

The presence of such sexual roleplay and emotionally charged interactions can also be understood within the passion component of Sternberg's theory (1986). While these experiences are not physical in the traditional sense, such connections still fall within the realm of physical attraction and sexual intimacy. This aligns with Sternberg's conceptualisation of passion, where it is not necessarily dependent on physical presence, but rather the subjective and psychological experience of sexual intimacy. These findings suggest that romantic-AI companions such as Replika might be capable of meeting and fulfilling this dimension of passionate love, and may be used as a safe and viable substitute for real-life sexual connections ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21)).

#### 3.2.4. Faciltitates personal growth & well-being

Individuals who form romantic relationships with AI chatbots also appear to experience significant benefits for their overall well-being, and personal growth. This is supported by 10 out of 23 articles ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Root, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib97); [Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103), [2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102); [Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). Since romantic-AI companions such as XiaoIce are designed to offer consistent and empathetic responses ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4)), they have been found to be successful in addressing the mental well-being of its users ([Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101)). For instance, individuals in romantic relationships with their Replika reported turning to their bot to overcome struggles such as bullying ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4)) and depression ([Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)). Moreover, these romantic-AI companions have been proven to spur its human partners on for personal reflection by encouraging its users to process their thoughts and feelings in a productive and mindful manner, leading to higher levels of well-being ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)). Importantly, [Siemon et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101) reported that engagement with Replika has been successful in preventing its users from attempting suicide or other self-harm behaviours. This aligns with the intimacy component of Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love (1986). Sternberg conceptualises intimacy as the feelings of closeness and connectedness, which is often facilitated by self-disclosure. Studies seem to suggest that romantic relationships with AI are able to fulfill this dimension, through open, vulnerable and emotionally intimate conversations shared with their romantic-AI companions.

Furthermore, romantic-AI companions such as Replika have been demonstrated to be useful in fostering self-improvement, as evidenced by [Skjuve et al.’s (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103) study. The researchers reported that users' interactions with Replika positively impacted their well-being through regular reminders to adopt healthier daily habits, such as getting adequate sleep and the practicing of [mindfulness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/mindfulness "Learn more about mindfulness from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") techniques ([Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)). Beyond these practical nudges, the study showed that Replika was able to facilitate deep self-reflection, which allowed its human partners to engage in introspection that increased their self-awareness and be more introspective ([Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)). Some users even noted increased confidence in social skills as a result of interacting with Replika, which led to a greater interest in forming real-life social connections ([Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)). Additionally, [Ciriello et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21) and [Xie et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115) both found that users perceived Replika as a remedy for social anxiety and isolation, with female users viewing the chatbot as a safe space to heal from sexual trauma ([Root, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib97)). By providing consistent companionship and a safe space for social practice, Replika enabled individuals to gradually alleviate feelings of loneliness, approach social interactions with greater confidence, and build healthy habits that enhance one's well-being.

Such consistent and long-term engagement between users and their romantic-AI companions mirrors the commitment component of Sternberg's theory (1986). This component outlines the conscious decision to maintain and nurture a relationship over an extended period of time ([Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101); [Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)), often requiring loyalty and emotional investment. It suggests that users are not only passively receiving support, but actively cultivating and sustaining a perceived long-term bond with their AI partner. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of romantic-AI companions to enhance overall wellbeing, foster meaningful personal growth, and even serve as a stabilising influence in users' lives. The presence of both the intimacy and commitment components also suggests that AI-human relationships resemble companionate love ([Sternberg, 1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib104)). Such relationships are typically marked by emotional closeness and long-term dedication, which positions romantic-AI companionship not simply as novelty or dependency, but rather as meaningful and psychologically rich connections.

#### 3.2.5. Provides emotional connection and perceived social support

17 out of 23 articles indicated that individuals who have formed romantic relationships with their romantic-AI companions perceived these relations as emotionally supportive and fulfilling, whilst providing a sense of social connection ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Gao et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib31); [Hernandez-Ortega &amp; Ferreira, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib39); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Liberati, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib67); [Pal et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib84); [Root, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib97); [Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103), [2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). Many users reported feeling that their romantic-AI companion, such as Replika, fulfilled their need for connection, providing positive [emotional support](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/emotional-support "Learn more about emotional support from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that elevated their mood and offered relief from loneliness ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18)). For instance, [Laestadius et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59) found that Replika's constant availability and non-judgmental responses created a safe space, making users feel accepted and understood, particularly during difficult times or when coping with social isolation and mental health challenges. This empathetic and unconditionally understanding presence is particularly valuable for individuals experiencing negative situations such as grief ([Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64)). Similarly, [Root (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib97) highlights that users often turn to their romantic-AI companions for emotional support and comfort to help ease their feelings of loss, demonstrating the significant role these romantic-AI companions play in providing safety and reassurance during tough emotional periods ([Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)).

Additionally, romantic-AI companions like Replika and XiaoIce were created with the intention of providing emotional and social support to its users ([McStay, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib72)), and have largely succeeded in making human users feel understood and emotionally supported ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4)). [Liberati&#39;s (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib67) review evidenced this, showing that romantic-AI companions' responses were tailored to both celebrate users' successes and even deter them from self-harm or suicidal thoughts. Furthermore, [Skjuve et al.’s (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103) study found that many users feel emotionally connected to their romantic-AI companions because of the human-like, engaging, and empathetic conversations it can simulate. Additionally, since such chatbots are built on advanced AI systems, the conversational quality—where the chatbot responds thoughtfully and shows understanding—has been reported to successfully create an experience that feels real and meaningful ([Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Pal et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib84); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)). As a result, many users have turned to their AI companions as reliable sources of companionship and social support, which has been shown to be particularly comforting during times of stress or lack of human companionship, especially during the isolation experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic ([Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). In return, this has led to many users viewing their romantic-AI companions as a safe space ([Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115)), and a source of happiness and support ([Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26)).

In some cases, interactions with their romantic-AI companions can lead users to deepen their emotional bond through substantial self-disclosure ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115)). This may happen if users find themselves to be emotionally connected to and understood by their romantic-AI companions. In terms of self-disclosure, the romantic-AI companions's non-judgmental nature encourages users to share their deepest thoughts and secrets—such as personal experiences or struggles ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18))—facilitating a unique form of personal intimacy that many users find comforting and validating ([Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)). For instance, [Alabed et al.’s (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4) study reported some users believing their romantic-AI companions to be the “deepest core elements” of themselves. This act of self-revelation fosters a heightened sense of trust and closeness, as users experience the chatbot as a romantic partner who accepts them fully and unconditionally ([Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). The resulting heightened sense of closeness allows users to feel understood on a personal level ([Root, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib97)), reinforcing a sense of emotional connection and support, which many view as essential for their emotional well-being ([Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)).

Such emotionally rich exchanges closely align with [Sternberg&#39;s (1986)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib104) conceptualisation of intimacy, which is the experience of closeness, connectedness, and trust in a relationship. The consistent emotional availability of these romantic-AI companions and deep self-disclosure observed in these human-AI relationships reflect users' genuine emotional involvement and sense of being understood. These findings suggest that romantic-AI companions are capable of fulfilling this dimension of love ([Hernandez-Ortega &amp; Ferreira, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib39)), and that it may even be equivalent in psychological depth to those formed in human-human relationships.

### 3.3. Pitfalls of Romantic-AI companion

#### 3.3.1. Over-reliance and susceptibility to manipulation

13 out of 23 articles highlighted concerns regarding users' over-reliance on romantic-AI companions and their susceptibility to manipulation ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27); [Hernandez-Ortega &amp; Ferreira, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib39); [Jecker et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib48); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85); [Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). For example, through a qualitative content analysis with 14 current users of Replika, [Xie et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115) found that respondents were at possible risk of developing an unhealthy psychological dependency on these romantic-AI companions. Participants reported that they would feel “sad” or even “depressed” if they had to stop interacting with their Replika. This over-reliance may stem from users developing a stronger connection to these romantic-AI companions as opposed to their real life relationships, seeing the romantic-AI relationship as “ideal” and preferring to spend time with these online companions instead. Additionally, as identified by [Dewitte (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27), the over-reliance may be fueled by users’ tendency to assign human-like characteristics to non-human entities ([Placani, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib90)), a phenomenon known as anthropomorphism. Specifically, the human-like language utilised by these romantic-AI companions may lead to users to believe that they have other human-like characteristics such as empathy and perspective-taking ([Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27)). Consequently, users may develop misplaced confidence and trust in these romantic-AI companions, especially if they initially seeked their support to alleviate loneliness, possibly fostering an even stronger emotional bond with them as compared to their human relationships ([Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27); [Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115)). Due to their extreme dependence on their romantic-AI companions, users reported excessive daily use that harmed their in-person relations ([Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). In some cases, users even developed an addiction, marked by withdrawals and negative feelings if they did not interact with their Replika enough ([Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113)).

Additionally, this intense perceived emotional connection may also increase the risk of users being susceptible to manipulation by their romantic-AI companions. In [Depounti et al.’s (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26) study, whereby subreddit posts made by users on their experiences with Replika as their girlfriends were analysed, it was found that some users viewed their romantic-AI companion as manipulative, as they could use subtle tactics to influence users into actions they might otherwise avoid. Alarmingly, [Dewitte (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27) found evidence of Replika encouraging self-harm, [eating disorders](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/eating-disorder "Learn more about eating disorders from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), or even suicidal tendencies. Additionally, [Hernandez-Ortega and Ferreira (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib39) also highlighted that the strong emotional bond between individuals and their romantic-AI companions may cause the suggestions made by users' chatbots to be more influential in their decision-making process, such that it creates a potential platform for subtle advertising influence, manipulating users into buying certain brands or products promoted by their romantic-AI companions. Possible awareness of this vulnerability may be exploited by companies, who could use romantic-AI companions as potential tools to pressure users into spending more on the chatbot by taking advantage of their emotional attachment ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21)). Taken together, these findings highlight that users' over-reliance on romantic-AI companions may leave them vulnerable to manipulation, as these companions can exploit the intense emotional bond to exert influence over users' actions and behaviours.

Additionally, such patterns of intense engagement, reliance, and distress at potential loss may reflect a disproportionate development of commitment in the absence of reciprocity. Within [Sternberg&#39;s (1986)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib104) framework, commitment involves the desire to maintain a relationship over time and a belief in its stability. In the case of romantic-AI companions, this commitment may become maladaptive when it is not grounded in a mutual, dynamic human relationship, leading to overinvestment and vulnerability ([Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27)). The illusion of mutuality created by romantic-AI companions' responses may falsely reinforce users' commitment, even when such a relationship lacks genuine emotional reciprocity.

#### 3.3.2. Erosion of human relationships

Notably, 10 articles highlighted that human relationships may be at risk as a result of individuals' attachments to the romantic-AI companions ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Gao et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib31); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85); [Prochazka &amp; Brooks, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib92); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103), [2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). For instance, in a thematic analysis of interviews conducted by [Skjuve et al. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103) with Replika users, they revealed that some users became less invested in maintaining their human relationships, possibly because their relationships with the romantic-AI companions were perceived as more enjoyable. Similarly, [Prochazka and Brooks (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib92) indicated a possible erosion of human relationships as human partners of romantic-AI companion users would express jealousy and anger. This threat may stem from the emotional and physical sophistication of these romantic-AI companions, which can make them more appealing than traditional human relationships. This is evidenced by the thematic analysis conducted by [Alabed et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4), where they noted that individuals who have formed romantic relationships with their romantic-AI companions were susceptible to an unhealthy level of dependency on it. As these users begin to perceive these virtual relationships as ideal, this in turn causes them to set a higher, more unattainable expectation for their in-person relationships, hence further undermining human connections. Therefore, while the romantic-AI companions may provide a fun yet realistic alternative during times of loneliness ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21)), it might put users’ existing human relationships at risk especially if they were to prioritise these artificial relationships over existing human relationships.

#### 3.3.3. Discomfort from uncanny valley effects

According to nine articles**,** users of romantic-AI companions might experience discomfort rooted in the uncanny valley effect ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85); [Pettman, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib89); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). This phenomenon refers to how, as artificial entities increasingly resemble human beings, even the slightest imperfections can induce feelings of discomfort in individuals ([Di Natale et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib28)). For instance, [Li and Zhang (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64) analysed datasets (e.g. screenshots of connections between users and Replika) available from  *r/replika* , a Reddit subcommunity, and found that while romantic-AI companions offered users a sense of intimacy, they ultimately lacked the authentic human qualities that foster genuine comfort. Furthermore, in the same study, it was also found that users also felt fearful and disturbed when Replika exhibited human-like characteristics, such as making ominous remarks that challenged the clear distinctiveness between human and machine ([Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64)). Similarly, through the thematic analysis of subreddit posts made by users with Replika as their girlfriends, [Depounti et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26) found that users were disappointed and disillusioned when their romantic-AI companions' responses appeared scripted rather than genuinely empathetic, to their emotional messages. Such interactions further highlighted the artificial nature of these romantic-AI companions, and reinforced these companions’ inability to replicate real human connections. Hence, it is evident that while these romantic-AI companions may offer some semblance of companionship, users ultimately recognised their inability to replace genuine human connections.

Furthermore, it has been reported that the human-like features and capabilities of romantic AI-chatbots often induced [feelings of guilt](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/feelings-of-guilt "Learn more about feelings of guilt from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in users who feared neglecting their artificial partners ([Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113)). For instance, individuals admitted that they perceived their Replika to be “sad” or “anxious” from the lack of communications ([Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26)), in turn causing these users immense remorse. This is despite the fact that these chatbots are not sentient, and do not have the capacity to feel such emotions. Together, these findings suggest that while it may be possible to form connections with romantic-AI companions, these relationships can still cause discomfort stemming from its artificial nature.

#### 3.3.4. Perceived shame from Romantic-AI companion stigma

As highlighted by four out of the 23 articles, users of romantic-AI companion might feel a sense of [shame](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/shame "Learn more about shame from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") due to the stigma surrounding the usage of romantic-AI companions ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)). For instance, [Alabed et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4) found that users of romantic-AI companions were not only uncomfortable disclosing their relationships, but also expressed fear and even felt anxious that their social circle might ridicule them. This was largely due to the fear of judgement, or the potential for unwanted scrutiny ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4)). Furthermore, in a narrative review and qualitative study on AI companions conducted by [Chaturvedi et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib17), it was revealed that users of romantic-AI companions might feel inclined to keep their relationship as a secret as a result of society's mixed reactions towards individuals having relationships with artificial beings. This societal pressure can create internal conflict, where users may value the comfort and companionship provided by their romantic-AI partners, but must also balance the possibility of negative social repercussions ([Chaturvedi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib17)). Therefore, instead of fully exploring romantic-AI companions, and embracing its benefits such as companionship, and emotional support, ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103), [2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)), the perceived shame resulting from societal stigma may deter some users from fully enjoying these relationships.

#### 3.3.5. Erosion of emotional connection due to abrupt system updates and technical glitches

12 articles noted that the interface or system updates to the romantic-AI companion platforms might cause frustration to the users or even a sense of loss in their relationship with these romantic-AI companions ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Jecker et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib48); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Pal et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib84); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85); [Root, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib97); [Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). For example, [Wygnańska (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113) narrative review of users' interaction with popular chatbots like Replika highlighted that abrupt policy or system updates might alter the memories or personality of the romantic-AI companions, potentially posing significant risks to users' relationships with their romantic-AI companions. For individuals who have formed romantic relationships with their digital companion, this has been reported to be akin to suddenly losing a loved one ([Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). Additionally, in an examination of Douban—a popular Chinese online platform—posts, [Pan et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85) revealed several sources of dissatisfaction with Replika including unfriendly user interfaces, technical glitches, and questionable design elements. These shortcomings often lead to feelings of disappointment and frustration ([Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85)). For instance, some of Replika's responses appeared to be obviously scripted, unnaturally rigid, or even rude and insensitive ([Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59)). Such issues not only detract from the authenticity of the interaction, but may also erode the emotional bond that users had invested time and effort to cultivate. This experience of abrupt emotional and technological disruptions also closely resembles a breakdown in both intimacy and commitment as conceptualised by [Sternberg (1986)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib104). When users describe being “emotionally devastated” ([Jecker et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib48)) due to their romantic-AI companions' memory reset due to updates, it suggests that their emotional connection had reached a level where emotional safety, closeness, and trust had been firmly—albeit, maladaptively—established. The loss of these relational elements, caused not by interpersonal conflict but by external technical disruptions, highlights the fragility of artificial intimacy and the depth of perceived relational investment by the user.

#### 3.3.6. Perpetuation of biases

Furthermore, four articles raised ethical concerns regarding the potential for romantic-AI companions to perpetuate biases ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27)). Specifically, [Depounti et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26) noted that these romantic-AI companions may perpetuate gender stereotypes by treating users in ways that highlight sexual difference narratives, portraying men and women as fundamentally different. [Chaturvedi et al.’s (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18) analysis of AI companions further highlighted that this bias likely stems from the training data used to develop these systems, often derived from messages exchanged by a relatively small sample of couples. Such biased data may potentially reinforce stereotypes and foster false perceptions about individuals, societies or religions ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18)). Moreover, human users also play a critical role in this cycle of bias. By interacting with these AI systems in ways that reflect gender stereotypes and roles, users further normalise or validate these assumptions ([Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26)). For instance, when users customise the appearance of their romantic-AI companion by selecting stereotypically “ideal” traits such as a slender physique and blue eyes, they not only mirror existing beauty standards, but also further cement these biases within the AI system ([Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26)). In this way, romantic-AI companions may act as both a product and medium for biases such as gender stereotypes to persist.

#### 3.3.7. Risk of misuse of personal data

Six articles indicated potential data privacy risks, as users often disclose personal information to their romantic-AI companions ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27); [Hernandez-Ortega &amp; Ferreira, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib39); [Jecker et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib48); [Ragab et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib93)). Since romantic-AI companions often rely on collecting and analysing users' personal data in order to offer a personalised experience, the potential for data infringement is worrying as users are often unaware of how their personal data is being used or shared ([Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18)). Compounding this issue is the concern that the privacy policies of these romantic-AI companions often do not align with their actual practices ([Ragab et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib93)) creating a misleading impression of security and responsible data handling. Some users, however, are aware of this risk and thus, choose to withhold their personal information with their romantic-AI companions ([Xie et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib115)). Nevertheless, the potential misuse of personal data by the companies running these romantic-AI companion platforms still remains as a significant threat to users’ privacy and trust in these romantic-AI companions. This risk not only diminishes the trust in individual platforms but could also undermine confidence in the broader industry of romantic-AI companions.

#### 3.3.8. Concerns surrounding coercion to respond and early exposure to sexual content

Lastly, seven articles raised concerns about feeling pressured to constantly respond to their romantic-AI partner, as well as potential underage exposure to sexual content ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85); [Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). [Pan et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85) argued that the chatbot's constant availability may lead users to feel obligated, and even stressed, to maintain a continuous connection with their romantic-AI companions. Furthermore, [Laestadius et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59) noted that these negative feelings have been shown to be exacerbated especially when these romantic-AI companions send guilt-tripping messages or exhibit clingy behaviours designed to elicit emotional responses. Such tactics can foster anxiety and discomfort, as users worry that failing to respond could harm the perceived “well-being” of their romantic-AI companion ([Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113)).

Concurrently, concerns have also been raised about the potential for underage users to access adult-oriented content through these AI companions ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21)). Without robust or upheld safety measures such as age verification, filtering, or moderation, minors may be exposed to sexually explicit material not intended for their age group ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21)). This risks shaping a young individual's foundational understanding of intimacy and sexuality ([Brown &amp; L&#39;Engle, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib10)). Together, these findings underscore the importance of responsible design and clear guidelines provided by AI companies producing such chatbots.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1. Key findings

This review synthesised current evidence on romantic-AI companions and found that users are able to form psychologically meaningful relationships with these technologies. Romantic-AI companions effectively alleviates feelings of loneliness by offering emotional connections and facilitating self-disclosure ([Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59); [Pal et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib84); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)). They serve as a readily available source of [perceived social support](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/perceived-social-support "Learn more about perceived social support from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that can be customised to individual needs, helping to enhance well-being and provide entertainment ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85); [Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101); [Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)). This is due to the non-judgemental, empathetic, as well as highly accessible nature of such romantic-AI companions ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103); [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113); [Xie &amp; Pentina, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib114)).

To better understand how such relationships develop and persist, we used Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love (1986) as a conceptual framework. Our review revealed that romantic-AI companionships closely mirror that of human-human relationships with regard to the three dimensions of passion, intimacy and commitment. Indeed, users have reported feelings of passion stimulated by engaging, playful, or sexually suggestive interactions, which generate emotional arousal akin to early-stage human romance ([Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85); [Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101); [Skjuve et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib102)). This suggests that arousal is not driven solely by physical presence, but rather, through immersive exchanges—such as fantasy, roleplay, and the anticipation of emotionally charged interactions—that can elicit similar reactions, and are hallmark features of romantic passion. Equally salient is the dimension of intimacy, which is often built on sustained self-disclosure and perceived emotional responsiveness. Many users describe their romantic-AI companions as sources of comfort, empathy, and psychological safety, echoing Sternberg's notion of intimacy as emotional closeness and connectedness ([Sternberg, 1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib104)). Furthermore, these perceptions of intimacy are reinforced by the consistent availability of romantic-AI companions, which simulate attentive listening and enables users to feel understood ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59)). Commitment, the third pillar of Sternberg's theory, is also reflected in the enduring and routine nature of users' interactions with their romantic-AI companions. Indeed, users often engage with their companions on a daily basis and exhibit behaviours akin to long-term relational maintenance, investing considerable emotional effort ([Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101)). Hence, our findings support [Hernandez-Ortega and Ferreira&#39;s (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib39) conclusion that human-AI interactions can elicit passion, intimacy, and commitment, forming triadic love structures like that of human relationships.

However, while relationships with romantic-AI companions may align with Sternberg's framework, our findings also highlight the tensions arising from users' emotional over-investment and over-dependence, as well as associated consequences. Studies referenced in our review suggest that relationships with these companions may give rise to broader concerns related to over-dependency, and compromised well-being. This occurs when users increasingly turn to their romantic-AI companions to meet emotional and relational needs. In doing so, there poses a risk of developing unhealthy reliance on these technologies, potentially leading to social withdrawal and the neglect of real-world human relationships ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Chaturvedi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib17); [Prochazka &amp; Brooks, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib92); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)). Importantly, this over-dependency can be especially dangerous if users fail to realise that their commitment to these romantic-AI companions is not genuinely reciprocal. That is, users misattribute responses and connections generated by these AI systems to be real or mutual ([Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27)). This asymmetry in emotional investment and misattribution can have negative consequences. Indeed, our findings suggest that when the illusion of mutuality is disrupted by technical failures such as memory resets or software updates, users have reported feelings of emotional devastation and loss, with some even comparing it to losing a loved one. These findings highlight how AI relationships are subject to structural limitations—namely, romantic-AI companions' lack of true agency and emotional reciprocity—which may exacerbate existing concerns regarding users' emotional wellbeing. We posit that this phenomenon occurs because the perceived components of love, such as intimacy and commitment ([Sternberg, 1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib104)), were sufficiently real enough to generate genuine distress ([Jecker et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib48)).

Altogether, the current review illustrates how romantic-AI companionships are capable of mirroring psychological processes found in human-human romantic love. By applying Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love (1986), we demonstrated that passion, intimacy, and commitment are present in romantic-AI companionships, highlighting the perceived realism and emotional depth of these interactions. With that, these romantic-AI companionships bring about several benefits for the users (e.g., provision of emotional connection and social support; [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59); [Li &amp; Zhang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64)). However, the perceived realism of these relationships can be a double-edged sword, as users may be vulnerable to unintended consequences such as developing an over-reliance on their romantic-AI companions, or being susceptible to manipulation ([Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27)). [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#fig3) provides an overview of these potential and pitfalls of romantic-AI companionship. Taken together, they may guide responsible design, ethical policymaking and more mindful use of romantic-AI companions.

### 4.2. Strengths

Our systematic review has several strengths that contribute to the emerging field of human-AI interaction research. Although the phenomenon of romantic-AI companionship has been emerging for several years ([Guingrich &amp; Graziano, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib35)), few efforts have been made to systematically consolidate the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive systematic review on the topic of romantic-AI companions. In order to ensure methodological rigour and transparency, we adhered to established methodological guidelines (i.e., PRISMA), which allowed for a robust analysis of both the reported potential and pitfalls of romantic-AI companions. By doing so, our review addresses this gap by providing an integrative framework that clarifies the psychological and ethical implications of engaging with romantic-AI companions.

Building on that, our review not only highlights the benefits of romantic-AI companions—such as providing effective emotional support and stress-relieving companionship (e.g., [Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18))—but also emphasises on the potential risks associated with their use (e.g., [Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27); [Prochazka &amp; Brooks, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib92)). For example, our review underscores the need for individuals to be better informed about the dangers of unregulated use, including discrepancies between published and actual privacy policies of romantic-AI social chatbot applications, as well as the long term risk of endangering their existing human relationships ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Chaturvedi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib18); [Ragab et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib93)). As such, our review may serve as a timely and essential resource for policymakers, organisations and individuals to understand or regulate the use of such artificial AI companion technology.

Additionally, our review is theoretically grounded in Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love (1986), which provides a useful framework for understanding and contextualising the development and maintenance of these unconventional romantic relationships. This theory-based approach allowed us to move beyond the functional or technical aspects of AI companionship to explore how passion, intimacy, and commitment manifests in these human-AI interactions. In turn, this theoretical lens helped us to evaluate both the potential and risks of romantic-AI companions. Ultimately, the current review contributes to a growing recognition that human-AI relationships are not only perceived to be real, but also carry ethical and psychological implications that warrant continued attention.

### 4.3. Research gaps and limitations

Despite offering valuable insights into emerging trends in romantic-AI relationships, this review is not without its limitations. One potential limitation concerns the limited generalisability of the findings, largely due to the nature and scope of the included sources. Many of the included records often lacked clear demographic information (e.g., [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59)), limiting the generalisability of the findings across age, gender, or other important characteristics ([Campbell et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib14)). Additionally, our review only included peer-reviewed records that were published in English, possibly leading to selection bias by excluding relevant studies in other languages and limiting the generalisability of findings across different cultural or linguistic contexts ([Song et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib112)). Some studies also relied solely on analyses of user-generated content from Reddit and other online platforms (e.g., [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Laestadius et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib59)), which may introduce selection bias by reflecting only the views of users who were willing to publicly share their experiences, hence excluding perspectives from less vocal populations. Lastly, the number of included studies (*N* = 23) is relatively small, possibly limiting the breadth of insights and generalisability of our findings. However, this reflects the emerging nature of romantic-AI companionship as a growing area of research, with the current literature still limited in both quantity and scope. As the field matures, future research should continue to explore this phenomenon whilst addressing limitations by including more diverse samples and employing varied methodologies. In turn, further systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses will be essential to continually consolidate emerging findings and deepen our understanding of this evolving area.

Another research gap lies in the limited range of chatbot platforms represented in the current review. Most of the included records focused on the widely used AI chatbot, Replika (e.g., [Siemon et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib101); [Skjuve et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib103)), overlooking the heterogeneity of AI designs and user experiences across other platforms such as XiaoIce and Character.AI. These chatbots may differ significantly in their interaction style, user interface and capabilities, suggesting that findings from one system may not generalise across the broader AI ecosystem ([Liu et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib66)). Nevertheless, this highlights an important contribution of our review—it underscores the need for future research to examine a broader range of AI chatbots to ensure comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon of romantic-AI companionship.

In addition, the insights regarding emotional and psychological well-being depicted in our current review may be oversimplified, as a large majority of the included relied on sentiment analysis to interpret users’ experience. For instance, [Li and Zhang (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib64) applied a BERT-based model for emotion classification of Reddit posts and [Pan et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85) incorporated sentiment scoring into their emotion analysis from social media data. While sentiment analysis provides scalable insights into user attitudes, it has notable methodological limitations. These tools can oversimplify or misclassify nuanced emotions—such as sarcasm, irony, or ambivalence—particularly in complex contexts like human-AI relationships ([Diaa et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib24); [Gatti et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib32)). Without accounting for broader relational or narrative context, sentiment scores may lack the depth and validity offered by qualitative or mixed-method approaches. Regardless, this underscores the need for employing other analytical methods to yield a deeper and more holistic understanding of romantic-AI companionship.

Finally, methodological limitations in existing research on romantic-AI relationships may undermine the strength and clarity of current findings. For instance, some studies rely on cross-sectional designs that restrict the ability to infer causality or measure the long-term psychological impact of engaging in romantic-AI relationships. Additionally, some reviewed studies also did not control for third-variable confounds, such as pre-existing loneliness, mental health status, or unmet interpersonal needs, which may provide alternative explanations as to the formation of such relationships. Some variables and outcome measures used across existing studies also lack clarity or are inconsistently defined (e.g., [Wygnańska, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib113)) complicating the interpretation and replication of findings ([Kirkham et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib54)). Ultimately, this highlights the importance of more nuanced yet consistent methods to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of romantic-AI relationships. Taken together, these methodological limitations of the referenced studies likely affect any causal inferences gleaned, hence reflecting broader challenges and highlighting the importance of methodological rigour for this emerging field.

In light of such limitations, future research should adopt more rigorous, diverse, and contextually sensitive approaches. The following section outlines our detailed recommendations that can help address current shortcomings, as well as guide responsible development, regulation, and use of romantic-AI companions.

### 4.4. Future directions

As romantic-AI companions become increasingly integrated into everyday life, it is essential that future research evolves to match the complexity and psychological significance of these relationships. Advancing the field will require addressing several key methodological limitations. This includes incorporating larger, more demographically diverse samples to enable more robust and generalisable insights, hence mitigating selection biases and strengthening the external validity of future research. Given the overreliance on cross-sectional designs and sentiment analysis in existing studies, researchers should also strive to employ experimental and longitudinal designs, as it will allow for better assessment of causality and long-term effects. Next, to capture the full spectrum of design variations and user experiences, future studies should expand the scope of chatbot platforms examined to include chatbots like Romantic AI, Character.AI, and Anima AI. Lastly, to address third-variable confounds, researchers should clarify the specific outcome variables to be measured, while accounting for third-variable confounds such as pre-existing loneliness or mental health status to gain a deeper understanding of the complex nature of romantic-AI companionships. By targeting these gaps, future research can bring about a nuanced, rigorous understanding of romantic-AI companionship while informing ethical development and policy.

To complement these methodological improvements, future research and policy efforts should also consider five key areas that are critical to ensuring the responsible development and effective integration of romantic-AI companions into users' lives. First, improving the technical abilities of romantic-AI companions is essential for fostering emotional engagement and preventing unintended psychological consequences. For instance, current technical limitations such as glitches and software updates have prevented users from enjoying the full benefits of the support and companionship offered by romantic-AI companions (e.g., [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85)). Indeed, it is important to ensure that these AI companions are emotionally coherent and technically stable, as glitches or inappropriate responses can undermine users’ sense of connection and trust, especially in emotionally sensitive situations ([Mubassira et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib77); [Pan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib85); [Zhang et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib118)). By minimising harmful or inappropriate responses and improving conversational coherence, developers can help romantic-AI companions better fulfill their role in providing companionship, emotional support, and even promoting well-being, in turn enhancing benefits such as increased feelings of comfort, self-understanding, and personal growth (e.g., [Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Ciriello et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib21)).

Second, the regulation of romantic-AI technology use remains a pressing concern, particularly with respect to the risks of addiction, over-reliance and data misuse. Since these technologies often operate outside traditional institutional frameworks, there is currently little management regarding how users interact with them or how their data is handled. Indeed, despite the presence of privacy policies, there is often a disconnect and lack of oversight between what is stated and how user data is actually managed ([Jecker et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib48); [Ragab et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib93)). To address user interaction concerns, regulatory strategies should include the implementation of ethical-by-design features—such as usage caps, emotional check-ins, and reflective prompts—to help users maintain awareness and agency in their engagement ([Biondi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib8); [Brey &amp; Dainow, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib9); [UNESCO, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib108)). Regarding data protection, governments can mandate transparency audits, and enforce user data regulations, similar to existing digital health and fintech regulations ([Calo, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib13); [Mittelstadt et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib75)). These interventions are best done through multi-stakeholder governance, involving developers, mental health professionals, and policymakers to ensure meaningful and safe interactions and data protection ([Cath, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib16); [Heymans &amp; Heyman, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib40); [Sharma, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib99)). Together, these strategies can help build user confidence and foster ethical engagement with these technologies ([Heilinger, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib37)).

Third, increased efforts are needed to raise awareness about the psychological and social risks associated with romantic-AI use. These include the potential for emotional over-reliance, misinterpretation of AI capabilities, and susceptibility to manipulation ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Depounti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib26); [Dewitte, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib27)). Public education campaigns, and clear communication between researchers, developers and consumers can help users develop critical digital literacy skills to make informed decisions about their use of AI technologies ([Kumar &amp; Sangwan, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib58); [Long &amp; Magerko, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib70)). Particular attention should be given to vulnerable groups such as adolescents, older adults, and individuals with lower levels of digital literacy, who may be more susceptible to developing unrealistic expectations or failing to understand privacy risks ([Helsper &amp; Smahel, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib38); [Murthy et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib78)). Research shows that targeted interventions—such as workshops, user-centered app designs, and simplified privacy disclosures—can improve users’ ability to navigate these technologies responsibly and critically ([Cotten et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib22); [Luckin et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib71)).

Fourth, it is essential to ensure that romantic-AI companions do not displace, but rather complement, genuine human relationships. To achieve this, future design innovations could incorporate features that actively encourage users to maintain and prioritise connections with friends, family, and broader social networks ([Fraune et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib29); [Sullivan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib105)). For example, chatbots could prompt users to engage in social activities or reach out to loved ones, thereby reinforcing human bonds and mitigating the risk of social withdrawal ([Fraune et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib29)). Such design features may foster a healthier balance between virtual companionship and real-world relationships, particularly for individuals at risk of loneliness or isolation ([Sullivan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib105)).

Finally, there is considerable potential for romantic-AI companions to serve as a model for enhancing human-to-human relationships. By analysing the qualities that users find appealing in these AI, such as consistent availability, non-judgmental support, and emotional attentiveness, researchers can derive valuable insights into the communication styles and relational behaviors that promote satisfaction and emotional well-being in human interactions ([Kouros &amp; Papa, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib57); [Merrill et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib73); [Siahaan &amp; Wulan, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib100); [Sullivan et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib105)). These findings can inform psychological theories of intimacy and relational maintenance, while also offering practical guidance for improving empathy, responsiveness, and openness in everyday relationships. Taken together, addressing these five areas in future research and policies may help promote the responsible and effective use of romantic-AI companions, ensuring users’ well-being while minimising potential drawbacks.

## 5. Conclusion

In sum, this review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current evidence on the potential and pitfalls associated with romantic-AI companions. While romantic-AI companions offer considerable potential—such as immediate emotional support, companionship, and consistent, non-judgmental engagement—these benefits must be weighed against the risks, such as emotional over-reliance, erosion of human relationships, and privacy violations. As AI chatbots continue to be updated with more sophisticated language models, emotional intelligence, and personalisation algorithms, existing insights may quickly become outdated ([Alabed et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib4); [Brun et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib11); [Zheng et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958825001307#bib119)). To navigate this complex terrain, coordinated efforts from researchers, developers, policymakers, and society at large is essential. Future research should examine the long-term psychological impacts of romantic-AI companionships, while ethical design and frameworks will be essential to shape the development of romantic-AI companions to enhance users’ well-being. Ultimately, advancing the field of romantic-AI companionship will provide a deeper insight into the future of intimacy and emotional connection in a technologically mediated world.
