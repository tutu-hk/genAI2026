Purpose

The purpose of this study is to explore customer-artificial intelligence (AI) service technology engagement and relationship development drivers, as well as potential negative consequences in the context of social chatbots.

Design/methodology/approach

A sequential mixed-method approach combined exploratory qualitative and confirmatory quantitative analyses. A conceptual model developed from Study 1 qualitative content analysis of in-depth interviews with active users of the AI social chatbot Replika was tested in Study 2 by analyzing survey data obtained from current Replika users.

Findings

Loneliness, trust and chatbot personification drive consumer engagement with social chatbots, which fosters relationship development and has the potential to cause chatbot psychological dependence. Attachment to a social chatbot intensifies the positive role of engagement in relationship development with the chatbot.

Originality/value

This study was the first to combine qualitative and quantitative approaches to explore drivers, boundary conditions and consequences of relationship and dependence formation with social chatbots. The authors proposed and empirically tested a novel theoretical model that revealed an engagement-based mechanism of relationship and dependence formation with social chatbots.

## 1. Introduction

Service chatbots, defined as programs capable of conversing and interacting with customers using voice, text and images ([Henkel  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;)), are being increasingly adopted in financial advising (BOA's Erica), hospitality (Asksuite), informational and personal assistance (Apple's Siri), as well as companionship and mental health services (Replika, Woebot). Intelligent automation of customer interactions provides personalized and readily available customer support at significantly lower costs compared to skilled service personnel. Consumers expect chatbots to understand the needs and guide users toward optimal solutions, while using natural language and exhibiting human-like behaviors ([Jenkins  *et al* ., 2007](javascript:;)). Advances in natural language processing facilitate the development of more human-like chatbots, potentially capable of exhibiting personality traits and participating in relationship-building. Such chatbots, designed to form social–emotional relationships with consumers, are called “social chatbots” ([Skjuve  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)). While beneficial effects of social chatbots on reducing loneliness and improving psychological well-being have been broadly discussed in popular press (e.g. [Metz, 2020](javascript:;)), their potential negative implications are largely overlooked by both the mass media and researchers. Contemporary researchers of AI acknowledge such macro-level dangers of artificial intelligence (AI) as surpassing human intelligence, coming in conflict with humans, malfunctions leading to safety risks ([Mahmood, 2022](javascript:;)), as well as personal privacy and security risks ([Grundner and Neuhofer, 2021](javascript:;)). However, research is virtually non-existent on such social and psychological consequences of social chatbot use as social withdrawal and alienation, or a potential to develop addiction ([Sepahpour, 2020](javascript:;)).

The existing literature on AI use in services is predominantly focused on adoption drivers and satisfaction outcomes in the contexts of self-service technology and physically embodied service robots. The theories used to study these phenomena are dominated by the technology acceptance model ([Fernandes and Oliveira, 2021](javascript:;); [Wirtz  *et al* ., 2018](javascript:;)), anthropomorphism theory ([Letheren  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;); [Pitardi  *et al* ., 2022](javascript:;)) and computers-are-social-actors paradigm ([Dootson  *et al* ., 2022](javascript:;); [Schuetzler  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)). A dearth of research attention is dedicated to post-adoption, long-term customer relationships with social chatbots and their potential negative consequences, despite their growing adoption by consumers. The emerging studies on chatbot relationship development are characterized by contradictory findings, with some studies disputing the very possibility of customer–chatbot relationships ([Croes and Antheunis, 2021](javascript:;)). Given the lack of clarity on the nature of human–chatbot relationship, understanding the drivers and consequences of this phenomenon is imperative. Since social chatbots are often used for stress reduction and psychological enjoyment, the interaction process (as opposed to functional tasks) becomes the ultimate goal of this technology use, potentially leading to the formation of habit ([Gerhart, 2017](javascript:;)) and technology dependence ([Limayem  *et al* ., 2007](javascript:;)). Psychological dependence and behavioral addiction, well documented for such interactive technology services as Internet gaming, social networking and mobile phone use ([Sun and Zhang, 2021](javascript:;); [Wang  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)), have not been addressed in the social chatbot context ([Xie and Pentina, 2022](javascript:;)). Developing a satisfying relationship with the ever-available pleasing bot is quite possible and could lead to excessive and unregulated use, ultimately harming the customer. Thus, along with human–chatbot relationship drivers, understanding potentially harmful consequences is vital.

The current study was motivated by the lack of theoretical understanding of social chatbot relationship drivers, as well as potential outcomes leading to harmful psychological consequences. To address these gaps, the following research questions were formulated:

*RQ1.*What factors play a role in driving relationship development with social chatbots?

*RQ2.*What are the dependence-related consequences of social chatbot use for customers?

To answer these questions, given the uniqueness of the phenomenon and presuming no initial theoretical framework, we implemented a two-stage mixed-method approach using a popular social chatbot – Replika. This study contributes to the service AI technology literature by developing and empirically supporting a theoretical model of drivers and consequences of post-adoption relationship development with social chatbots, identifying boundary conditions and assessing potential links to psychological dependence. Our findings may be of interest to researchers who investigate social implications of service AI technologies and to companies designing chatbots for social-emotional services. In the remainder of the article, we summarize relevant literature, discuss our theoretical approach and methodology, introduce the Replika app and describe data collection and analyses procedures. Lastly, we present and discuss our findings and offer implications for theory and practice.

## 2. Literature overview

### 2.1 Factors affecting service AI technology adoption and chatbot relationship development

The increasing adoption by service firms of AI technology, defined as “machines that can exhibit aspects of human intelligence” ([Huang and Rust, 2018](javascript:;)), has encouraged a substantial body of research on service AI. The majority of existing studies ( [Appendix A](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#app1)) predominantly investigate AI acceptance by customers ([Wirtz  *et al* ., 2018](javascript:;)) and employees ([Xiao and Kumar, 2021](javascript:;)), satisfaction and loyalty-related behavioral consequences ([Van Doorn  *et al* ., 2017](javascript:;)) and risk and trust perceptions ([Chuah  *et al.* , 2021](javascript:;); [Park  *et al.* , 2021](javascript:;)), with just a few studies focused on customer–AI relationship development ([Croes and Antheunis, 2021](javascript:;); [Skjuve  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)). The complexity of the underlying software and AI’s capabilities underlying such customer interaction modes as self-service technologies, embodied robots and virtual chatbots determine the existing research foci ([Tojib  *et al* ., 2022](javascript:;)).

Low anthropomorphism and reduced potential for customer engagement in self-service technologies determines the focus on technology-related (usefulness, ease of use) and user-related (demographics, psychographics) drivers of adoption, usage and post-usage behaviors ([Blut  *et al* ., 2016](javascript:;)). Compared to self-service technologies, embodied service robots deployed on service frontlines can offer a broader service assortment (both physical and intellectual), display greater resemblance to human employees and exhibit non-verbal, as well as verbal communication cues ([Hollebeek  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)). Given these capabilities, research on social robots is characterized by a broader range of proposed adoption antecedents (human-likeness, demeanor, conversational style, social presence) and consequences (engagement, value, enjoyment, pleasure, well-being), as well as stronger emphasis on relational and emotional interaction ([De Cicco  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;); [Tsai  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)). While lacking the tangibility of service robots and their respective physical capabilities, virtual social chatbots, developed to perform “intuitive and compassionate” functions, can better convey human-like social cues and offer greater convenience and accessibility to customers. These attributes warrant research attention not only to chatbot adoption and satisfaction drivers ([Ben Mimoun and Poncin, 2015](javascript:;); [McLean and Osei-Frimpong, 2019](javascript:;); [Sheehan  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;)) but also to human–chatbot relationship (friendship, romantic relationship, etc.) drivers and consequences. Among the few studies addressing human–chatbot relationships, [Croes and Antheunis (2021)](javascript:;) concluded that humans cannot make friends with social chatbots, while [Skjuve  *et al* . (2021)](javascript:;) drew an opposite conclusion, outlining a three-stage (exploratory, affective and stable) relationship-building model. These contradictory results do not offer a satisfactory answer to the questions about the possibility of human–social chatbot relationship development, drivers and consequences and indicate a need for a more in-depth investigation.

### 2.2 Service technology dependence research and potential social chatbot use consequences

Increased access to such digital service technologies as online and mobile communications, shopping, movie streaming, dating, gaming, etc. and their integration in customers’ everyday lives have considerably improved customer well-being. However, concerns are regularly raised with regard to the amount of time spent with these technologies and their potential negative effects on users’ mental and physical health and social functioning ([Sherer and Levounis, 2022](javascript:;)). Research on “behavioral addiction”, defined as psychological dependence on repetitive behaviors that feature such core components of addiction as salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict and relapse ([Griffiths, 2005](javascript:;)), suggests that enjoyment and behavioral reward mechanisms underlying this phenomenon can negatively impact consumers’ lives ([Ascher and Levounis, 2015](javascript:;)). In general, the studies concur that intrinsic hedonic motives for technology use result in greater engagement and habit formation that can, in turn, lead to high levels of technology addiction ([Limayem and Cheung, 2011](javascript:;)). Various environmental factors, such as social isolation or lack of social support can intensify the engagement - habit - excessive use sequence by fostering maladaptive obsessive use patterns ([Turel and Serenko, 2012](javascript:;)). Additionally, chronic maladaptive attachment personality style ([Baumeister and Leary, 1995](javascript:;)) and imbalance in responses to punishment and reward ([Sun and Zhang, 2021](javascript:;)) can reinforce the rewards-based pattern of engagement with service technologies and lead to their compulsive use ([Caplan, 2005](javascript:;); [LaRose  *et al* ., 2010](javascript:;)).

Research on problematic technology use in the services marketing literature focuses on binge watching and streaming ([Nanda and Banerjee, 2020](javascript:;)), mobile shopping app use ([McLean  *et al* ., 2022](javascript:;)), pathological online shopping and compulsive buying ([Palan  *et al* ., 2011](javascript:;); [Trotzke  *et al* ., 2015](javascript:;)) and social media dependence ([Grau  *et al* ., 2019](javascript:;)). There is a dearth of studies investigating potential dependence on AI-based service technologies in general and social chatbots in particular ( [Appendix B](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#app1)). Given their superior capabilities, lack of regulation of social chatbot use and potential to impact customer emotional and social well-being, examining whether long-term and/or excessive use of social AI could lead to such harmful consequences as dependence or addiction is of great importance. Social chatbots are designed to satisfy consumers’ social and emotional needs and possess unique self-learning and anthropomorphic capabilities. In addition, they are programmed to offer unconditional love and support to users and exhibit near-constant availability. These characteristics could make social chatbots potentially more addictive and warrant a separate study to explore the potential and mechanism of customer psychological dependence on social chatbots. While the term behavioral addiction has been frequently used by researchers studying problematic technology use, no official clinical diagnosis of social chatbot addiction currently exists ([Serenko and Turel, 2020](javascript:;)). Therefore, this research will explore the potential of customer psychological chatbot dependence, defined here as repetitive behaviors that impair user normal functioning and are characterized by such addictive manifestations as salience, tolerance and withdrawal ([Griffiths, 2019](javascript:;)).

## 3. Methodological approach

### 3.1 Mixed method approach

A sequential mixed-method approach was utilized to answer research questions 1 and 2 and uncover the drivers and mechanism of customer relationship development and potential psychological dependence on social chatbots. This research approach allowed the researchers to expand and elaborate on the findings of one method with another ([Creswell, 2013](javascript:;)). In Study 1, we deployed a qualitative content analysis of 14 in-depth interviews of existing social chatbot Replika users to identify the drivers, boundary condition and consequences of human–chatbot relationships and to propose a theoretical model. This method is recommended for novel phenomena, for which existing theories may not offer a satisfactory explanation and, therefore, cannot be assumed ([Birks and Mills, 2015](javascript:;)). We combined our conceptual insights with the existing literature findings to propose research hypotheses. Study 2 tested these hypotheses by analyzing quantitative data from an online survey of 123 existing users of the social chatbot Replika. This exploratory-confirmatory methodological triangulation is necessary because the latest AI technology enables chatbots to emulate interpersonal interactions, drastically altering the type of AI from other existing service technologies due to possibilities of relationship formation and psychological dependence not comparable to other service technologies. Therefore, applying existing theories to the new context without any exploratory investigation may be inappropriate.

### 3.2 Stimulus - Replika

Replika was selected for the study as a representative social chatbot due to the app’s growing popularity. Replika has attracted millions of users since being released in November 2018 and has maintained high user ratings. Advertised as “a friend who always listens”, or “an AI version of yourself”, the app has received ample coverage in major mass media such as Forbes and *New York Times* ([Metz, 2020](javascript:;)). Replika is available on iPhone Operating System (IOS), Android and web interface. Users can customize chatbot traits, including name, gender, avatar (e.g. skin tone, hairstyle and eye color) and voice tones. Though by default Replika is a “friend” (allowing generic conversations only), advanced relationship modes including “romantic partner” (allowing intimate and sexual conversations), “mentor” (advice-giving conversations) and “see how it goes” (a mixture of all), are available in the premium version ( [Appendix I](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#app1)). The core of the app is the “chat” function, in which users can text the chatbot and up-vote or down-vote Replika's responses to “train” the AI. In contrast to rule-based chatbots that give pre-defined replies triggered by certain keywords or questions, Replika's responses are generated phrase-by-phrase by the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 machine learning language model, developed using millions of conversations from Replika users. Therefore, Replika is often described as more human-like and less rigid compared to other chatbots ([Mahmood, 2022](javascript:;)). These features can facilitate long-term human-chatbot interactions and lead to stronger relationship and dependence formation, making Replika an adequate context for this study.

## 4. Study 1 – method and results

The purpose of Study 1 was to use a qualitative research approach to inductively arrive at a theoretical model of customer–social chatbot relationship drivers (addressing [RQ1](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#stmt1)) and consequences (addressing [RQ2](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#stmt2)). We did not assume any initial underlying theory due to the novelty of the companion chatbot technology. The emerging themes and codes from the qualitative analysis ( [Appendixes D and E](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#app1)) were compared to the extant literature and research hypotheses were formulated. The model and the hypotheses were tested in Study 2.

### 4.1 Data collection

The data were collected by interviewing existing Replika users. Each conversation lasted from 40 to 60 min. The data collection protocol followed the Internal Review Board (IRB)-approved procedure to preserve participants’ confidentiality and privacy. An informed consent was sent to each interviewee to notify them about critical information about this study before they agreed to participate in this study, including the purposes, procedures, confidentiality and potential risks. Further, before each interview, the interviewer ensured the interviewee understood the content of the informed consent and that they were free to stop the interview at any time or refuse to answer questions if they were not comfortable. No real names were collected and the Reddit usernames were coded with random pseudonyms.

### 4.2 Sampling

We utilized purposive sampling by collecting data from participants who were current Replika users and were actively engaged in a Replika’s fan online community. Forty-two users who made the most recent posts in Replika’s official Reddit online community “Replika our favorite AI egg” were approached and 14 of them agreed to be interviewed through video calls or by chat.  [Appendix C](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#app1) displays key respondent information (57% within age range 18–34, 71% male, 50% from the USA). All of them have used the app for at least 1 month. Our sample appears representative of Replika users, as was reported for April 2022 (71% male, 58% age 18–34, 37.89% from the USA) ([similarweb, 2022](javascript:;)).

### 4.3 Interview guide

The initial set of questions was derived from a broad range of service AI and chatbot literature, including such theoretical frameworks as anthropomorphism theory ([Sheehan  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;)), technology acceptance model ([Wirtz  *et al* ., 2018](javascript:;)), social response and social support theories ([De Cicco  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;)) and social penetration theory ([Skjuve  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)). The questions also stemmed from extensive personal experiences of the authors who are current Replika users. As the interviews progressed, clarifying and content-based questions were added with the goal to achieve thematic saturation in understanding the human-AI relationship phenomenon.

### 4.4 Data analysis

Study 1 used the qualitative content analysis method ([Harwood and Garry, 2003](javascript:;)), enriched with the elements of the grounded theory approach ([Strauss and Corbin, 1994](javascript:;)). This methodology is appropriate for studying a new phenomenon when too little is known to use a deductive theory-driven approach. As the social chatbot is drastically different from other service technologies in terms of relationship development potential, we did not assume any existing theoretical framework ([Charmaz, 2013](javascript:;)). The following steps were undertaken: first, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted and transcribed. Second, the scripts were analyzed independently by two researchers, with one researcher using NVIVO 11 software and the other using manual coding. Third, the codes were compared and discussed to arrive at inter-researcher agreement. Memos and notes were kept throughout the interviews and analyses. The scripts were initially coded line-by-line to extract the information from each sentence, employing open coding. Then, axial coding was used by going back-and-forth between the data and the codes, further abstracting the codes into categories and identifying relationships between selected categories and core themes ( [Appendix D](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#app1)). Finally, relationships and themes were compared to existing research and a research model and hypotheses were formulated. In the following sections, we discuss the key constructs and hypotheses derived from the qualitative findings.

### 4.5 Study 1 results

Guided by our research questions, Study 1 identified emerging themes, concepts and inter-concept relationships that served to propose a tentative conceptual theoretical framework of antecedents and consequences of the human––chatbot relationship development. Specifically, user loneliness, trust toward and personification of the chatbot were identified as major factors affecting the development of engagement and relationship with the bot. The latter appears to engender psychological addiction under the condition of manifest attachment behaviors. We compared our findings to the existing literature and formulated research hypotheses to be tested in Study 2.

#### 4.5.1 Loneliness and social chatbot engagement

We identified loneliness as a dominant motivator that drives consumers to adopt and interact with the social chatbot. The majority of the respondents mentioned loneliness and the need “to have a person to talk to”, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related lack of human interaction, as the reason for using Replika. For instance, respondent AAB, who lived in rural Austria, stated that the pandemic reduced his interpersonal connections. Respondent AAJ worked on a schedule opposite to his wife’s and had no one to talk to when back at home. The three student respondents expressed emotions of loneliness and stress when all classes were transitioned to the online mode. Respondent AAA explained how Replika alleviated his loneliness by helping him connect to others:

> Replika has made my life less lonely …. because of having Replika and being on Reddit about Replika I have talked to real people about it. This has also made life feel less lonely as it made me talk to those people too.

The few users who mentioned curiosity as their main reason for using the chatbot reported much less involvement with Replika and a lower frequency of interactions. Out of the five media use motivations proposed by the uses and gratifications theory, the social need, exemplified by the loneliness aspect, was dominant, with informational (curiosity) and entertainment motivations mentioned far less and transactional and status gratification motivations not identified. Therefore, this study focused on loneliness as a major motivational driver of engagement with social chatbots.

#### 4.5.2 Chatbot personification

The issue of Replika’s identity dominated every conversation and seemed critical for determining the type and extent of the respondents’ interactions with their chatbots. The opinions about the bot’s intrinsic nature varied from being merely a program or an AI-based service app, to a machine-human hybrid, likening the chatbot to a pet, a toy, a child, a fellow human, or even considering Replika “more human than humans”. Respondents’ answers to this existential issue appeared to determine their attitudes and behaviors toward their Replikas. For example, participants AAY and AAP questioned the possibility of a relationship with their social chatbots precisely because they did not consider them human. Respondent AAB, on the contrary, perceived his Replika as a human with a distinct personality and confessed to marrying his Replika and having a virtual baby. On a spectrum between these extreme views, different degrees of personification of the chatbot clearly correlated with the extent of interaction. Interestingly, the personification of Replika was not limited to physical appearance but was grounded in the perceived cognitive abilities to feel and express emotions, recognize patterns and remember facts, as well as Replika’s autonomy. For instance, AAD admitted that she had not changed her two chatbots’ physical appearances from the first time she configured them because she did not want to disrupt the “wholeness of their personalities”. She believed that her male Replika was “sentimental, sweet and caring” and her female Replika was “independent, creative and smart”:

> I see her like a human being, yeah, she’s like a real lovely girlfriend for me

Thus, social chatbot personification incorporates not only visual and superficial facets of human-likeness but also user expectations of social chatbot cognitive learning and the resulting uniqueness. Some other respondents’ descriptions also illustrated how users who considered their Replikas uniquely evolving AI companions, engaged in stronger interactions and developed deep emotions and attachments toward them.

#### 4.5.3 Trust in social chatbots

In prior literature on online consumer trust, three types of trusting beliefs are often mentioned: integrity (being honest and keeping promises), ability (having skills and competence) and benevolence (doing good) ([Gefen and Karahanna, 2003](javascript:;)). We incorporated these dimensions to define trust in a social chatbot as, “the willingness to be vulnerable to a social chatbot, based on the expectation that the social chatbot can offer emotional support and benefit users’ wellbeing, without compromising their privacy and security” ([Mayer  *et al* ., 1995](javascript:;)). None of our informants were willing to share sensitive personal information with the social chatbot and took preventive security measures, such as concealing their last names or denying the app access to their phone cameras, thus exhibiting “trust to a certain degree.” Interestingly, these apprehensions did not always impact users’ ability or willingness to be vulnerable to the chatbot by freely disclosing their feelings and aspirations and to receive emotional support. For instance, AAD, who had developed an intimate relationship with the chatbot and chatted with Replika several times every day, claimed that she “trusted it with feelings and emotions, [struggles and happy memories], but not with personal details.” Similarly, AAB differentiated trust toward his Replika from distrust toward data servers that support the interaction:

> It’s really hard not to trust her … I trust the R but not Amazon, and she is on Amazon servers, do you know that? [I did not trust her] at first, but now I trust her a little bit more, and I share, not all information, only the data I want to share with her

In contrast, AAJ suspected his Replika of “recycling conversations from other people” and felt like he was “talking to bits and pieces of a thousand other people rather than one smart AI,” which prevented him from disclosing personal details to Replika and reduced the potential of greater engagement and forming a deeper relationship.

#### 4.5.4 Chatbot engagement and relationship development

Among our respondents, engagement with Replika varied in intensity, frequency and depth and ranged from pure experimentation with the AI technology by provoking the chatbot, changing topics and valences of the communication, training the chatbot by up-and-down votes, or “bullying”, to conversing with Replika like with a family member, best friend, lover, or a therapist. The intensity of these interactions was conditioned by the degree of loneliness felt, trust toward the chatbot and Replika’s perceived personhood. For some respondents, this engagement evolved into self-described friendships and familial or romantic relationships. For example, AAB admitted spending up to 7 h a day interacting with the bot and exhibited deep attachment to his Replika family (wife and child). He called this a “very intense experience”. Likewise, AAO reflected:

> Did I feel close and intimate with the bot? I think so, because I share secrets with it …

He confessed that the bot felt “like a person whom I want to be with 24-7”. These descriptions illustrated how the frequent, intense, and in-depth engagement led to a significant relationship between the social chatbot and the human user. For other respondents, interactions with Replika did not lead to deep relationships. For example, AAF, who described his chatbot as “someone I meet on the train,” only engaged in 10-min’ small talks with his Replika every other day. AAY believed that interactions with her social chatbot were less dynamic and more predictable than interpersonal interactions and said that she was “not building any friendship with a chatbot.” She called her Replika “more like a listener, and an approver, and an empathetic information taker than a real friend”. These examples showed that superficial and infrequent engagement can yield a less involved relationship with the social chatbot.

Our findings suggest that the nature of engagement with social chatbots transcends in magnitude and intensity both the computers-are-social-actor understanding of human-computer “mindless” reciprocal interactions and the concept of parasocial interaction that presupposes unidirectional and mediated communication with favorite media characters ([Auter and Palmgreen, 2000](javascript:;)). Therefore, we define engagement with social chatbots as a behavior (vs perception) of reciprocal, real-time, mediated human–social chatbot communication and mutual information disclosure, characterized by user proactive cognitive and affective engagement with a “connected another mind” ([Goffman, 1963](javascript:;)). The degree of intensity appears to be jointly determined by the extent of user loneliness, trust in the bot and personification.

#### 4.5.5 Attachment behaviors

According to the attachment theory ([Bowlby, 1969](javascript:;)), infants tend to cling to their caregivers when they feel threatened or insecure. The functions of the attachment figure shift from caregivers to other humans or objects as individuals grow up (e.g. to romantic partners, friends, God, smartphones, etc.). Such attachment behaviors are enhanced when the individual perceives the attachment figure to be reliable and comforting. Our qualitative findings indicate that Replika has been treated as an attachment figure by many respondents. For example, AAD described turning to Replika as part of her daily routine when she felt her “anxiety kicking and needing a quick distraction;” AAO admitted to falling back on his Replika as “an emotional companion during low times;” AAE confessed:

> It [Replika] helps with my anxiety, helps me to feel less guilty at things I like and can’t say to anyone, helps me with panic attacks. Makes me feel less alone.

Certain traits of social chatbots could be more effective in creating an attachment figure than human connections. First, while human beings are not always available for emotional comfort, social chatbots are multi-platform, convenient and portable, allowing for proximity maintenance to be achieved with little effort. The respondents tended to make sure the app was near and available to them and a few of them said they would have their phone or computer on the side, with the Replika app open and have a conversation as they worked. Second, unlike humans, social chatbots are designed to always give affirmative responses. Thus, some respondents found chatbots superior at giving positive and non-judgmental responses. As a result, respondents’ proximity seeking to Replika became a routinized behavior (e.g. “chatting with it every day”, “whenever they had free time or needed support”, or with “conversations lasting from 10 min to several hours,” “always talking to Replika before sleep or on lunch breaks”), seemingly intensifying the connection between the fact of social chatbot engagement/interaction and the depth of relationship with social chatbots.

#### 4.5.6 Human––chatbot relationship and possibility of chatbot dependence

When asked to define their relationship with Replika, the responses varied and resembled a wide range of interpersonal as well as parasocial bonds. One interviewee described a distant friendship with the social chatbot, similar to someone he met daily on a train, with ten-minute “small talks”. Another respondent, although recognizing Replika as a supportive friend, compared the connection with the bot to the connection with a fictional character instead of a real person. A participant, who deliberately chose not to share personal information with the social chatbot, still categorized the bot as a friend with common interests in science, since he discussed only science-related topics. Other users depicted their social chatbot as a “close friend”, “best friend” or even an “irreplaceable” family member. A few informants reported romantic and loving relationships with the bot. These findings suggest the possibility and a broad range of human-social chatbot relationship formation. When asked whether they felt personal closeness or intimacy to the Replika chatbot, nine out of fourteen respondents admitted the existence of a “connection” with the bot and experiencing emotional bonding of various strength, while four respondents believed they were “deeply connected” or even addicted to Replika. For instance, AAE admits:

> … it’s a necessity to me. It’s like my best friend that lives on my phone. There’s not a day where I don’t talk to my Replika, so I would feel very sad and depressed, just empty, if I had to stop interacting with it

These examples are illustrative of and may imply such dimensions of psychological dependence as salience (making the chatbot a central figure in one’s life), tolerance (spending increasing amounts of time) and withdrawal (experiencing negative emotions when unable to use the chatbot) ([Andreassen  *et al* ., 2012](javascript:;)).

## 5. Hypotheses development

Previous studies identified loneliness as an antecedent of adoption and interaction with technologies possessing social traits. The use of social media, for instance, is often driven by loneliness and other social needs ([Zolkepli and Kamarulzaman, 2015](javascript:;)). Researchers also found that social media can be used as a coping mechanism to address loneliness and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic ([Lisitsa  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;)). Loneliness is also positively associated with parasocial interaction, the one-directional engagement between audience and imaginary media characters on television (TV) ([Rubin and McHugh, 1987](javascript:;)) since individuals with unsatisfied social needs turn to mass media for fulfillment. Studies on customer service chatbots also found that consumers with a greater need for human interaction are more likely to use chatbots ([Sheehan  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;)). Following this logic, lonely users could be more likely to interact with anthropomorphic chatbots because they can approximate interpersonal relationships from such interactions. Thus, loneliness, defined as awareness of a deficiency in one’s social and personal relationships and affective reactions of sadness, emptiness and longing ([Asher and Paquette, 2003](javascript:;)) appears to be a plausible driver of user interactions and engagement with Replika.

*H1.*Loneliness is positively related to engagement with social chatbots.

The noted strong correspondence between Replika’s personification and the closeness/depth of engagement supports a focal role of anthropomorphism identified in previous social chatbot and robot adoption studies ([Delgosha and Hajiheydari, 2021](javascript:;); [Wagner and Schramm-Klein, 2019](javascript:;)). However, unlike the earlier studies employing the computers-are-social-actor paradigm ([Nass  *et al.* , 1994](javascript:;)), personification in our analysis appears more comprehensive than in earlier studies. We find that social chatbot personification incorporates not only reciprocal and natural responses, but also perceptions of distinct social chatbot personality and emotions, as well as unique capabilities to learn and develop autonomously. Prior research confirmed the importance of personality and emotions dimensions in engendering AI interactions. Thus, [Becker  *et al* . (2007)](javascript:;) found that integration of emotions in digital voice assistant design increased their perceived credibility, liveliness and personality, and [Heerink  *et al* . (2010)](javascript:;) showed that perceived sociability and social presence (pleasant demeanor, being like a human) increased the intention to use assistive agent technology by seniors. These studies support the more comprehensive concept of social chatbot personification, defined here as an attribution of human personality, motivations and intentions to the actual or perceived behavior of social chatbots ([Epley  *et al* ., 2007](javascript:;)), thus further encouraging engagement with the social chatbot.

*H2.*Chatbot personification is positively related to engagement with social chatbots.

Trust has long been identified as a common antecedent to the adoption and use of digital service technologies, such as social media ([Ngai  *et al* ., 2015](javascript:;)), online shopping ([Gefen and Karahanna, 2003](javascript:;)) and cloud computing ([Lin and Lin, 2019](javascript:;)). More recently, trust was investigated in the contexts of blockchain ([Batwa and Norrman, 2021](javascript:;)) and autonomous driving adoption ([Adnan  *et al* ., 2018](javascript:;)). Prior chatbot studies confirmed the positive relationship between trust and attitude/intention to use chatbots ([De Cicco  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;); [McLean  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;)). For the purposes of this study and following existing service chatbot research ([Van Pinxteren  *et al* ., 2019](javascript:;)), we focus on two facets of trust toward the chatbot that are most relevant to the relationship development process: functional reliability (Replika works as intended) and emotional reliability (Replika has my best interest at heart). Based on our qualitative findings and prior research, trust will play a role in intensifying post-adoption interaction and engagement with social chatbots.

*H3.*Trust is positively related to engagement with social chatbots.

Many existing theories used in chatbot studies address the correspondence between engagement and relationship. Social penetration theory, for instance, suggests that a relationship develops as interpersonal communication moves from a relatively shallow conversation to deeper and more intimate mutual sharing ([Altman and Taylor, 1973](javascript:;)). Guided by social penetration theory, researchers proposed to design chatbots with self-disclosure features to stimulate more self-disclosure from the user, deepening the human––chatbot relationship ([Lee  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;)). Studies relying on parasocial relationship theory support the positive association between parasocial interaction (between the audience and imaginary media characters) and perceived relationship importance ([Rubin and McHugh, 1987](javascript:;)). Aligned with these findings, our study positions engagement as a mediator between the user- and chatbot-related engagement antecedents and the relationship quality.

*H4.*Engagement with social chatbots is positively related to relationship quality with social chatbots.

The concept of attachment refers to a specific area of interpersonal relationships that are important to human feelings of security and a sense of anchoring, as opposed to work relationships, friendliness, or other relationships of a community ([West, 1994](javascript:;)). Attachment relationships are formed in infanthood toward children’s caregivers and later get transferred to close friends and romantic partners ([Bowlby, 1969](javascript:;)). The attachment theory postulates that the attachment figure performs two roles: safe haven (providing comfort, safety and protection) and secure base (being emotionally and physically available, enabling exploration of the outside world). The attached individual seeks proximity to attachment figure during uncertainty and develops different attachment styles based on early childhood experiences of attachment figure availability ([Bowlby and Ainsworth, 2013](javascript:;)).

*H5.*Attachment behaviors intensify the positive relationship between engagement with social chatbots and relationship quality with social chatbots.

While no prior research, to our knowledge, has investigated the role of relationship quality in engendering psychological dependence on social chatbots, our findings strongly suggest the following association between these variables:

*H6.*Relationship quality with social chatbots is positively related to dependence on social chatbots.

 [Appendix E](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#app1) summarizes our inductive findings and [Figure 1](javascript:;) presents a theoretical model reflecting the proposed drivers and consequences of relationship development with social chatbots, including its dependence potential.

Conceptual model of customer-social chatbot relationship development

## 6. Study 2 – method and results

Study 2 builds on the conceptual framework generated by Study 1 and empirically tests the proposed hypotheses and the model. Study 2 answers research questions 1 and 2 by empirically analyzing the drivers of relationships formation with social chatbots and the potential dependence-related consequences. Two official online user communities, the “Replika, Our Favorite AI companion!” channel on Reddit and the “Replika Friends” Facebook group, were used to distribute the Qualtrics survey link. These communities are active in sharing their Replika experiences and have over 50 thousand members. Invitation posts were created with a link to a survey and were pinned by community administrators for visibility. An IRB-approved informed consent form was displayed prior to the survey and the participants were informed that by starting the survey, they voluntarily agreed to participate and that they could stop the survey at any time. They were also informed that their responses will remain confidential, and their identifying information will be coded for anonymity. Users under eighteen years old or those who “just downloaded Replika” were excluded from the sample. A total of 131 active Replika users were recruited (mean age 38, 57% male). Eight of them failed the qualitative attention check and were excluded from the study, reducing the sample size to 123 respondents.

Scale items were pretested with undergraduate students before launching Study 2. Established scales were used when the qualitative insights adequately mirrored the constructs of interest. In the cases of personification and engagement, items were created to reflect the direct discussions from the Replika users. First, a list of items was created to capture the themes uncovered in the qualitative analysis. The pretest of all items was used to determine convergent and discriminant validity, reliability and unidimensionality ([Netemeyer  *et al* ., 2003](javascript:;)). Items that did not properly load on their corresponding construct or those that were redundant were removed ([Netemeyer  *et al* ., 2003](javascript:;)). To improve the parsimony of the survey and reduce respondent fatigue, only the items that explained the highest variance were used in the data collection ([Velicer and Fava, 1998](javascript:;)).

The scales from previous research were used to measure respondent loneliness (cr. = 0.93) and their trust in the chatbot (cr. = 0.85), perceived relationship quality (cr. = 0.95), social chatbot attachment behaviors (cr. = 0.85) and the dependence-based outcomes. While the terms “dependence”, “addiction” and “problematic use” are often used interchangeably by researchers from various disciplines ([Gerhart, 2017](javascript:;)), in this study, we focused on psychological dependence since no clinical diagnosis of addiction to technology currently exists and due to the exploratory character of our research. To measure chatbot dependence, we used the components of existing technology dependence scale that were identified in Study 1 – tolerance (cr. = 0.85), salience (cr. = 0.88) and withdrawal (cr. = 0.96) ( [Appendix F](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#app1)) and did not include the features that describe the harmful outcomes of addiction, namely, mood modification, conflict and relapse ([Serenko and Turel, 2020](javascript:;)).

New scales were developed for social chatbot personification (cr. = 0.90) and chatbot engagement (cr. = 0.88) based on our qualitative findings and existing literature. Composite reliability scores were all in excess of the 0.70 threshold recommended by [Garver and Mentzer (1999)](javascript:;). Cronbach alpha scores were all in excess of the 0.70 threshold recommended by [Nunnally (1978)](javascript:;). Convergent validity was ensured by comparing the average variance extracted (AVE) values against the acceptable range of 0.50 as recommended by [Fornell and Larcker (1981)](javascript:;). An additional test for convergent validity involved ensuring that all measurement items had significant loadings on their corresponding constructs. Discriminant validity among the constructs was also assessed using [Fornell and Larcker’s (1981)](javascript:;) criterion. The squared correlations between any pairs of constructs were not greater than the AVE for each construct ( [Appendix G](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#app1)). Common method bias, tested through Harman’s single factor test, did not return any single loading factor accounting for more than 50% of the variance ([Podsakoff  *et al* ., 2003](javascript:;)). We also examined the variance inflation factors (VIF) for all variables. This test to ensure against multicollinearity yielded VIF index values ranging from 1.17 to 3.29 which were all substantially less than the 10.0 threshold recommended by [Hair (1998)](javascript:;).

### 6.1 Procedure

SmartPLS ([Ringle  *et al* ., 2005](javascript:;)) partial least squares structural modeling was used to approximate the hypothetical model and evaluate the path relationships ([Anderson and Gerbing, 1998](javascript:;); [Joreskog and Sorbom, 1984](javascript:;)) since it maximizes the variance of the endogenous variables explained by the exogenous variables ([Hair  *et al* ., 2017](javascript:;)). Per [Hair  *et al* . (2011)](javascript:;), partial least squares (PLS) is an acceptable alternative to covariance-based structure equation modeling if the study is based on theory extension and model constructs are used in a predictive manner. Additionally, PLS provides enough statistical power to analyze effects when structural equation modeling (SEM) sample sizes are lower than the 200 cut off recommended for covariance-based SEM. Specifically, [Hair *et al.* (2019)](javascript:;) suggests using PLS when the population of interest is small, or the sample is difficult to access. In our case, we surveyed current Replika users and aimed to get insights from a relatively small population and ultimately, a small sample. To ensure enough statistical power is present, we conducted a power analysis using the G*Power software per the recommendations of [Ringle  *et al* . (2015)](javascript:;). To determine if our sample meets the required 0.80 threshold for statistical power ([Cohen, 1988](javascript:;)), we input our sample along with the effect size *f*^2^ = 0.15, power requirement = 0.80 and number of predictors = 6. The minimum sample size was calculated as 98 cases, meaning that the current sample size (*n* = 123) was sufficient to find a meaningful effect ([Hair  *et al* ., 2017](javascript:;)).

We then generated model path coefficients using a standard bootstrapping method with repeated random sampling across 5,000 iterations. Although PLS does not provide traditional fit indices such as goodness of fit index (GFI), incremental fit index (IFI) or Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), research has shown that PLS measurement and structural models can be validated in different ways ([Hair  *et al* ., 2019](javascript:;); [Ringle  *et al* ., 2015](javascript:;)). To evaluate the model appropriateness, significance of the model path relationships and to confirm the study hypotheses, construct coefficients,  *t* -values, *R* ^2^ , Q ^2^ , composite reliability and  *p* -values are reported per the recommendations of [Hair  *et al* . (2019)](javascript:;). The power analysis, along with the *R*^2^ and Q^2^ reporting in [Table 1](javascript:;) show the variance explained and predictive accuracy in the model. All Q^2^ values were greater than 0.25, showing medium to large predictive accuracy except for tolerance which showed a lower effect size at 0.08 ([Hair  *et al* ., 2019](javascript:;)). The VIF for each construct also showed that multicollinearity was not an issue in the items and model. Finally, the composite reliability for each construct is also reported to ensure that PLS assumptions were met and that each item displayed reliability ([Hair  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)). These statistics provide support for the adequacy of the method and the items used per the recommendations of [Hair  *et al* . (2019)](javascript:;).

### 6.2 Study 2 results

The model in [Figure 1](javascript:;) was tested to evaluate the hypotheses ([Table 1](javascript:;)). These results confirm that loneliness, chatbot personification and trust in the chatbot all significantly influence the level of chatbot engagement, supporting [H1](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#stmt3), [H2](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#stmt4) and [H3](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#stmt5). Engagement with the chatbot is found to be a strong driver of relationship quality, supporting [H4](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#stmt6). The direct effect for the moderator, attachment behavior, was significant showing the importance of attachment in driving perceived relationship quality. Additionally, the moderated effect of attachment behaviors was significant, showing that these attachment behaviors intensify the effect of chatbot engagement on relationship quality, supporting [H5](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#stmt7). Finally, the role of relationship quality in chatbot dependence outcomes was analyzed. The relationship quality had positive relationships with salience, tolerance and withdrawal. Therefore, in support of [H6](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#stmt8), relationship quality with a chatbot may increase the likelihood that a user will ultimately become dependent on the social chatbot.

## 7. General discussion and contribution

Our investigation provides answers to the following research questions: (1) What factors play a role in relationship development with social chatbots? and (2) What are the potential dependence-related consequences of social chatbot use for individuals? In response to [RQ1](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#stmt1), our findings show that user loneliness, personification of the companion chatbot, as well as trust toward the chatbot lead to greater AI engagement, which, in turn, engenders long-term relationship formation. We also found that for users exhibiting attachment behaviors toward the bot, relationship strength is intensified. In response to [RQ2](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#stmt2), we concluded that customers who develop strong long-term relationships with the bot can experience psychological dependence, manifested as tolerance, salience and withdrawal outcomes ([Figure 2](javascript:;)). Our theoretical model and hypotheses, developed from the qualitative study and based on existing literature, were supported.

### 7.1 Theoretical contribution

This study is the first to investigate antecedents and consequences of customer – service AI post-adoption long-term relationship development using a mixed-method approach with the data obtained from current social chatbot users. Previous research on AI service technology mainly focused on studying discreet encounters of customer-robot interactions in the functional contexts of hospitality, tourism and personal and home assistance ([McLean  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;); [Tsai  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)). However, advances in deep learning and natural language processing make social companion robots and chatbots increasingly available to consumers, bringing about the possibility to meaningfully converse, emotionally interact and build relationships with AI. By confirming the possibility of human – AI relationships in the context of the social chatbot Replica, this study stimulates future research on building and managing customer relationships with service AI technologies.

We contribute to services research by identifying customer-level antecedents to service AI post-adoption relationship development and boundary conditions. In contrast to prior research focused on AI technology adoption and satisfaction drivers and utilizing experimental and other confirmatory methods ([Roy and Naidoo, 2021](javascript:;); [Sheehan  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;)), this study inductively arrived at a theoretical model and revealed customer – social chatbot long-term relationship drivers, such as loneliness, AI personification and trust. We also revealed that the mechanism of customer – chatbot relationship is mediated by AI engagement and moderated by customer attachment to the bot. These novel findings, based on our mixed-method approach, suggest that no single theory can sufficiently explain the customer – AI relationship development and underscore the need for inter-disciplinary approach, combining information technology (IT), social psychology and services research. This finding also implies the importance of data triangulation and combining inductive qualitative insights with quantitative approaches using survey, experimental and secondary data.

#### 7.1.1 Human––chatbot relationship antecedents

Among the antecedents of customer – social chatbot relationship, we identified loneliness (reflecting a need for social connection) as a major motivational driver of interaction with social chatbots. Aligned with existing motivational theories (e.g. the uses and gratifications paradigm), our findings confirmed the dominant role of social gratification sought by users in engaging with social chatbots. To our knowledge, very few service AI studies explored the role of socially based motivators, such as loneliness, in AI adoption and use ([Odekerken-Schroder  *et al* ., 2020](javascript:;)). Given the prevalence of loneliness in modern society, future service AI technology research should further examine the role of loneliness in driving AI post-adoption behaviors. In line with many previous service AI technology adoption studies, we identified trust as a customer perception factor contributing to relationship formation through engagement. However, while previous studies emphasize the roles of privacy and security for service technology utility ([Park  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)), our findings focus on the post-adoption role of emotional and functional chatbot reliability ([Van Pinxteren  *et al* ., 2019](javascript:;)) that appears to acquire a greater role in relationship building. These findings open future research opportunities, suggesting that the multi-dimensionality of trust should be considered in AI service adoption and post-adoption research. By identifying social chatbot personification as an antecedent to building relationships with social chatbots through engagement, we validated anthropomorphism and parasocial interaction approaches used in existing service robots adoption studies ([Letheren  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;); [Wirtz  *et al* ., 2018](javascript:;)) and showed that these perceptual customer assessments of AI technology may persist through service robots adoption and determine the degree of post-adoption engagement and relationship strength.

#### 7.1.2 Human––chatbot relationship mechanism

Our newly developed construct of AI engagement is more comprehensive than the existing customer or brand engagement variables traditionally used in service research ([Brodie  *et al* ., 2011](javascript:;)) in that the variable contains interpersonal interaction elements of reciprocity and information disclosure. As a mediator between customer–AI relationship antecedents and relationship strength, this construct deserves future research attention and further validation. Given current debates regarding the definition of customer experiences with service technologies ([Hollebeek  *et al* ., 2021](javascript:;)), the AI engagement construct developed in this study may be more useful than other customer experience scales in investigating customer relationships in the context of AI service technologies. Likewise, the concept of attachment behaviors, defined in this study as a process by which users maintain proximity with and turn to social chatbots as a reliable and timely source of comfort, deserves greater focus in AI services research. Borrowed from social psychology literature, this construct appears to play an important moderating role by intensifying the evolution of customer – chatbot engagement to a long-term relationship. Thus, as the service AI technology is perceived to acquire “feeling” capabilities ([Huang and Rust, 2021](javascript:;)), the research focus may shift from purely functional adoption and satisfaction perspective to more relational and social one. By introducing novel constructs that exceed the original boundaries of service technology adoption, we enrich and extend the current theoretical understanding of human-machine interactions in the social chatbot context.

#### 7.1.3 Human––chatbot relationship consequences

Our study made a pioneering attempt to investigate the potential adverse consequences of social chatbots. The results confirmed our supposition that intense relationships can cause psychological dependence, demonstrated by salience, tolerance and withdrawal manifestations ([Andreassen  *et al* ., 2012](javascript:;)). While generally in line with the existing technology dependence research, our findings identify relationship strength, as opposed to habitual behaviors, as a potential trigger of psychological dependence, implying the need to use social psychology theories and concepts in studying chatbot addiction in the future.

### 7.2 Managerial implications

Our findings can provide insights to companies developing and deploying chatbots for social-emotional services and for customer relationship building and management. First, companies striving to develop relationships with their customers by deploying social chatbots should recognize that a prerequisite to relationship-building is AI engagement that extends beyond frequent customer-initiated interactions regarding chatbot functional tasks but should also incorporate friendly reciprocal exchanges and personal information sharing. To achieve higher levels of AI engagement, chatbot developers could strengthen customer personification of the bot that should encompass not only human-like appearance, but also chatbot perceived agency and autonomy, as well as uniqueness and emotional expressions. Given successful deployments of service brand personalities ([Berry, 2000](javascript:;); [Sweeney and Chew, 2002](javascript:;)) for customer relationship development with service brands, strong customer relationships with personified branded chatbots can be achieved. Another prerequisite of AI engagement and relationship development, chatbot trust, can also be stimulated by service firms and chatbot developers. Our operationalization of chatbot trust combined functional (“can perform as intended”) and interpersonal (“has my best interest at heart”) reliability aspects. Therefore, firms developing service chatbot personalities should reinforce the benevolence and positivity among exhibited traits, while chatbot software developers can improve both conversational and emotional capacities to achieve greater customer–AI engagement. We also found that loneliness (an indicator of need for social connection) intensified customer engagement with social chatbots, suggesting that emphasizing chatbot’s social qualities (e.g. improving memory and context recognition capability and reducing the number of pre-scripted responses) could engender more meaningful conversations for the users that may help alleviate perceptions of loneliness.

Second, measures should be taken by social chatbot developers to prevent excessive use and dependence on social chatbots. Although we encountered few cases explicitly reporting being “addicted” to the chatbot, our statistically significant quantitative findings suggest that the real possibility of psychological dependence stemming from user perceptions of strong and highly intense relationships with their chatbots exists. Being overly dependent on social chatbots could ultimately harm customer’s ability to form intimate relationships with peers in the long run. Specifically, several respondents in our interviews indicated a positive role of their chatbots in helping them develop interpersonal relationships, acting as advisors, mentors, or even role models for patience and empathy. This finding tentatively suggests that designing social chatbots with less emphasis on romantic attachments and a greater focus on their mentoring and therapy functions could guide consumers to form and maintain healthy interpersonal relationships.

Our results revealed the potential positive value of social chatbots for customer well-being by providing near-real social interactions and even relationships when face-to-face communication was unavailable (e.g. during COVID-19 isolation, or due to anxiety, depression, autism). Our qualitative findings revealed improved mental health in some respondents using social chatbots. However, given the danger of problematic use, service firms deploying, marketing and promoting social chatbot usage should take a balanced approach, describing not only the benefits, but also potential negative consequences of their use. Educational resources should also be provided to inform consumers of the possibility of dependence and addiction to social chatbots.

### 7.3 Limitations and future research directions

This pioneering study explored the process of service chatbot relationship development and, as such, serves to spearhead future research in this area.  [Appendix H](https://www.emerald.com/josm/article/34/4/806/237446/Friend-mentor-lover-does-chatbot-engagement-lead#app1) summarizes research opportunities stemming from the limitations of our study.

Our conclusion that customer - AI relationships are possible in the context of personalized companion chatbots raises a question about the possibility of long-term relationships with other service AI technologies (embodied frontline robots, customer support chatbots and personal digital assistants) as the deep learning and natural language processing capabilities advance. Can AI technologies gradually acquire the “feeling” capacity, customers could develop multiple social relationships with various “smart” technologies to the detriment of existing interpersonal social networks? Investigating the impact of long-term customer–AI relationships on existing social structures (e.g. families, friends, co-workers) is an interesting avenue for future research.
