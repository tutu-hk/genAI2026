| B+ / B / B- | 15, 14, 13 | Mostly accurate but with minor omissions or simplifications | **Core:** Captures most main ideas; no personal views included.<br>**B+ (none); B (any 1); B- (both) from below:**<br>• May include some unnecessary details.<br>• May contain minor inaccuracies in wording/emphasis (no major misinterpretation).<br>*Note: Inappropriate word choices do not impede communication.* |

## 3. Paraphrasing (20%)

|-------------|--------|------------|--------|
| A / A- | 19, 18, 17, 16 | Independent rewording and precision in meaning | • Fully reworded in student's own voice; no direct copying of phrases/structures.<br>• Accurately conveys original idea without distortion or oversimplification. |
| B+ / B / B- | 15, 14, 13 | Partial originality and occasional source reliance | **Core:** Mostly student's own phrasing; meaning generally correct.<br>**B+ (seldom); B (occasional); B- (sometimes) from below:**<br>• May contain near-identical sentence structures from source.<br>• May lose nuance or include minor inaccuracies (does not impede communication). |

| D or below | 9, 8, 7 | Verbatim copying and plagiarism | • Direct copying of phrases, sentences, or passages with no meaningful rewording.<br>• **D:** Copying + meaning preserved.<br>• **F:** Copying + meaning NOT preserved. |
