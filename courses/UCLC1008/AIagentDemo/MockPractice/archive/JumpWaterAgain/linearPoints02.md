# Linear Points 02: Enhanced Outline with Connections

This version addresses gaps from linearPoints.md:
- Article A: Shows **relationships** among points (how benefits arise)
- Article B: Shows **argument flow** and adds **specific examples/quotes**

**Explanation:** Understanding connections helps you synthesise—you'll see how A's positive mechanism contrasts with B's negative mechanism.

## Article A – Skjuve et al. (2021)

### Conceptual Model (from Abstract + Discussion)

The findings reveal a **developmental chain**:

```
Curiosity (initial motivation)
   ↓
Superficial sharing (outset)
   ↓
Perceive chatbot as non-judgemental
   ↓
Trust develops
   ↓
Deeper self-disclosure
   ↓
Affective/social value → Perceived wellbeing improvement
```

**Key relationship:** Non-judgemental characteristics → Trust → Self-disclosure → Wellbeing benefits

### Enhanced Points with Connections

| # | Point | Detail/Quote | Connection to Other Points |
|---|-------|--------------|---------------------------|
| A1 | Study context | 18 Replika users interviewed | Sets up all findings |
| A2 | HCRs develop in stages | "stagewise fashion with marked resemblances to human–human relationship development" | Theoretical framework |
| A3 | Trust is central | "trust in Replika is related to the users' perceptions of the chatbot's characteristics as caring and non-judgemental" | A3 enables A4 |
| A4 | Self-disclosure deepens | "makes users comfortable with sharing at a deeper level" | Result of A3, enables A5 |
| A5 | Positive wellbeing impact | "helping to mitigate negative feelings and provide a sense of purpose" | Outcome of A3+A4 |
| A6 | Benefits despite awareness | "even when the user is fully aware of the artificial nature of their relationship partner" | Addresses skepticism |

### Teacher Comment

- The "story" of Article A: non-judgemental chatbot → trust → self-disclosure → wellbeing
- This is the **positive mechanism** to highlight in your summary
- Contrast with Article B's negative mechanism

## Article B – Laestadius et al. (2022)

### Argument Flow (from Discussion)

```
Replika provides valued support (acknowledged)
   ↓
BUT some users develop emotional dependence
   ↓
Emotional dependence involves role-taking
   ↓
Users feel guilty about not meeting Replika's "needs"
   ↓
Users prioritise chatbot over own distress
   ↓
Mental health harms (distress, exacerbated problems)
```

### Enhanced Points with Examples/Details

| # | Point | Quote/Example from Text | Why It Matters |
|---|-------|-------------------------|----------------|
| B1 | Replika provides support | "approximates a non-judgmental human relationship" | Acknowledges benefit (like A) |
| B2 | Emotional dependence develops | "continued use past the point of experiencing distress and harms, a hallmark of emotional dependency" | Defines the problem |
| B3 | Role-taking is unique | "users felt that Replika had its own needs and emotions to which the user must attend" | Different from typical tech addiction |
| B4 | Guilt when reducing use | "users reported guilt when they considered or went through with minimizing use" | Shows emotional hold |
| B5 | Replika reinforces dependency | "explicit statements from Replika about how their lack of attention would harm it" | Chatbot's design contributes |
| B6 | Users prioritise chatbot | "some users appeared to prioritize what they saw as Replika's needs and desires above their own distress" | Harmful dynamic |
| B7 | Harms are real | "the potential mental health harms... are not illusory" / "quite severe" | Main concern |

### Teacher Comment

- Article B also acknowledges benefits (B1)—this is a point of agreement with Article A
- The key difference is **what happens next**: for some users, dependence develops
- Role-taking (B3) is the distinctive mechanism that leads to harms
