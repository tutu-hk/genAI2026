# Synthesis Plan: Linking Article A and Article B

This document maps connections between points from both articles and plans the structure for the summary.

**Explanation:** Synthesis means showing how ideas relate—not just summarising each article separately. This plan identifies shared ground and contrasts.

## Point Connections: A ↔ B

| A Point | B Point | Connection Type | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| A3 (non-judgemental → trust) | B1 (non-judgemental support) | **Agreement** | Both acknowledge non-judgemental quality is valued |
| A5 (wellbeing benefits) | B1 (valued support) | **Agreement** | Both agree chatbots CAN provide benefits |
| A5 (positive impact) | B7 (mental health harms) | **Contrast** | A focuses on benefits; B focuses on harms |
| A3/A4 (trust → disclosure) | B3/B6 (role-taking → prioritising chatbot) | **Contrast** | A: healthy mechanism; B: unhealthy mechanism |
| A6 (benefits despite awareness) | B4/B5 (guilt despite knowing it's AI) | **Contrast** | A: awareness doesn't reduce benefits; B: awareness doesn't prevent harm |

## Synthesis Strategy

### Shared Ground (Agreement)

Both articles agree that:
- Chatbots like Replika can provide valued support
- Non-judgemental quality is important
- Users form emotional connections with chatbots

**Use in summary:** Acknowledge this shared ground before highlighting the contrast.

### Key Contrast to Highlight

| Article A | Article B |
|-----------|-----------|
| Focuses on **benefits** | Focuses on **harms** |
| Trust → self-disclosure → wellbeing | Emotional dependence → role-taking → distress |
| Users benefit from non-judgemental support | Some users develop unhealthy dependency |
| Positive mechanism | Negative mechanism |

### Thesis Statement Elements

- Topic: AI companion chatbots and their impact on humans
- Preview: contrasting perspectives (benefits vs. harms)
- Framing: wellbeing support vs. emotional dependence

---

## Structure Plan

### Introduction
- **Background:** AI chatbots increasingly used for social/emotional support
- **Thesis:** two perspectives—chatbots can support wellbeing (A) BUT may also cause harms through emotional dependence (B)

### Body Paragraph(s)

**Option 1: Two separate paragraphs**
- Body 1: Article A (benefits)—trust, self-disclosure, wellbeing
- Body 2: Article B (harms)—emotional dependence, role-taking, distress

**Option 2: One integrated paragraph (recommended for synthesis)**
- Topic sentence: impact of chatbots depends on the nature of the relationship
- Point cluster 1: A+B agree chatbots can provide valued support (shared ground)
- Point cluster 2: A says this leads to wellbeing; B warns some users develop emotional dependence
- Point cluster 3: B's unique concern—role-taking and prioritising chatbot over self

### Conclusion
- Brief restatement: chatbots offer benefits but carry risks for vulnerable users
- Tension: positive potential vs. harm potential

## Point Clusters for Body

| Cluster | A Points | B Points | Focus |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| Cluster 1 (shared) | A3 (non-judgemental support) | B1 (valued support) | Agreement: chatbots CAN help |
| Cluster 2 (contrast) | A5 (wellbeing benefits) | B2/B7 (dependence → harms) | What happens next differs |
| Cluster 3 (B's warning) | — | B3/B4/B6 (role-taking, guilt, prioritising) | Unique harm mechanism |
