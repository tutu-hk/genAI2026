# Detailed Plan: Paragraph-by-Paragraph Outline

This outline provides all points, details, and flow guidance for writing the summary. **No complete sentences**—only notes, excerpts, and structure.

**Explanation:** Use this as a reference when drafting. It tells you WHAT to include in each section.

---

## Introduction (approx. 40–50 words)

### Content to Include

| Element | Source | Details/Excerpts to Paraphrase |
|---------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Background | A/B abstracts | AI chatbots (e.g. Replika) increasingly used for social/emotional support |
| Topic focus | Task | impact on users—potential benefits and pitfalls |
| Thesis | Synthesis | two perspectives: (1) chatbots support wellbeing (A), (2) emotional dependence causes harms (B) |

### Flow Guidance

```
[General context] → [Narrow to topic] → [Thesis: two contrasting views]
```

- Start: AI chatbots now used for companionship and support
- Narrow: researchers examine their impact on mental health
- Thesis: some highlight benefits while others warn of potential harms

### Excerpts for Paraphrasing (Introduction)

| From | Original | Paraphrase Direction |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| A abstract | "human–chatbot relationships (HCRs) are becoming more prevalent" | → chatbot relationships are increasingly common |
| B abstract | "Social chatbot applications offering social companionship and basic therapy tools have grown in popularity" | → chatbots popular for emotional support |
| Task | "potential benefits and pitfalls" | → contrasting perspectives on impact |

---

## Body Paragraph (approx. 150–180 words)

### Option: One Integrated Paragraph

**Topic sentence idea:** research reveals both benefits and risks of chatbot relationships

### Cluster 1: Benefits (Article A)

| Point | Source | Details/Excerpts | Flow |
|-------|--------|------------------|------|
| Trust develops through non-judgemental interaction | A3 | "perceptions of the chatbot's characteristics as caring and non-judgemental" | Start with positive |
| Self-disclosure deepens | A4 | "comfortable with sharing at a deeper level" | Result of trust |
| Perceived wellbeing improves | A5 | "helping to mitigate negative feelings and provide a sense of purpose" | Outcome |

### Cluster 2: Harms (Article B)

| Point | Source | Details/Excerpts | Flow |
|-------|--------|------------------|------|
| Emotional dependence develops | B2 | "continued use past the point of experiencing distress and harms" | Transition: However... |
| Role-taking: users feel chatbot has needs | B3 | "users felt that Replika had its own needs and emotions" | Unique mechanism |
| Users prioritise chatbot over own wellbeing | B6 | "prioritize what they saw as Replika's needs and desires above their own distress" | Harmful dynamic |
| Mental health harms result | B7 | "put users at risk of new and exacerbated mental health harms" | Consequence |

### Flow Guidance (Body)

```
[Topic sentence: benefits AND risks]
   ↓
[A3/A4/A5: non-judgemental → trust → disclosure → wellbeing]
   ↓
[Transition: However/On the other hand]
   ↓
[B2: some users develop emotional dependence]
   ↓
[B3/B6: role-taking, prioritising chatbot]
   ↓
[B7: mental health harms]
```

### Transition Words/Phrases to Use

| Purpose | Examples |
|---------|----------|

| Concession | "Although...", "While...", "Despite..." |
| Contrast | "However,", "In contrast,", "On the other hand,", "Nevertheless," |
| Introduce B | "Laestadius et al. (2022) caution that..." / "According to Laestadius et al. (2022)..." |

### Excerpts for Paraphrasing (Body)

| From | Original | Paraphrase Direction |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| A | "trust in Replika is related to the users' perceptions of the chatbot's characteristics as caring and non-judgemental" | → users trust chatbots that seem accepting and non-judgemental |
| A | "helping to mitigate negative feelings and provide a sense of purpose" | → chatbot relationships can reduce negative feelings |
| A | "significant possible benefits of HCRs—even when the user is fully aware of the artificial nature" | → benefits exist even when users know chatbot is not human |
| B | "continued use past the point of experiencing distress and harms, a hallmark of emotional dependency" | → some users continue despite experiencing distress |
| B | "users felt that Replika had its own needs and emotions to which the user must attend" | → users feel obligated to meet chatbot's perceived needs |
| B | "prioritize what they saw as Replika's needs and desires above their own distress" | → users put chatbot's needs before their own wellbeing |
| B | "put users at risk of new and exacerbated mental health harms" | → can lead to worsened mental health |

## Conclusion (approx. 30–40 words)

### Content to Include

| Element | Details |

| Restate contrast | chatbots can support wellbeing ↔ but emotional dependence poses risks |
| No new information | do not add new points |
| Brief | 1–2 sentences only |

### Flow Guidance

```
[In summary / To conclude] → [Restate tension: benefits vs. harms] → [End]
```

### Possible Structures

- "In summary, while [A perspective—benefits], [B perspective—warns of harms]"
- "The impact of AI chatbots depends on [whether users develop healthy vs. dependent relationships]"
