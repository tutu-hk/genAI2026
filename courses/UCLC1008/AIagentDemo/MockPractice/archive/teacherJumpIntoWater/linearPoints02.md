# Linear Points 02: Enhanced Outline with Connections

This version addresses gaps from linearPoints.md:
- Article A: Shows **relationships** among points (from abstract)
- Article B: Adds **examples and details** from the text

## Article A – Hong et al. (2022)

### Conceptual Model (from Abstract)

The abstract reveals a **causal chain**:

```
DBVW (privacy concerns) ──[negative]──→ Perceived Value
                                              ↓
Tech Innovativeness ──────[positive]──→ Perceived Value ──→ Continuance Intention
```

**Key relationship:** Two factors (DBVW and tech innovativeness) influence perceived value, which then predicts intention to continue using FRT.

### Enhanced Points with Connections

| # | Point | Data/Detail | Connection to Other Points |
|---|-------|-------------|---------------------------|
| A1 | Study context | 380 parents in China surveyed on FRT in elementary schools | Sets up all findings |
| A2 | DBVW (privacy anxiety) | Score 3.865 > 3.0 (neutral) → parents worried about privacy | A2 negatively affects A4 |
| A3 | Tech innovativeness | Score 3.796 > 3.0 → parents open to new tech | A3 positively affects A4 |
| A4 | Perceived value | Score 3.919 > 3.0 → parents see FRT as valuable | A4 positively affects A5 |
| A5 | Continuance intention | Score 3.776 > 3.0 → parents want to keep using FRT | Outcome of A4 |
| A6 | Overall finding | Despite risks (A2), parents value (A4) and support (A5) FRT | Synthesis of A2–A5 |

### Teacher Comment

- The abstract shows **how** the points connect (causal model)
- Don't just list points—show the logic: privacy concerns exist BUT perceived value is still high BECAUSE of tech openness → leads to continued support
- This is the "story" of Article A

## Article B – Andrejevic & Selwyn (2020)

### Enhanced Points with Examples/Details

| # | Point | Example/Detail from Text | Why It Matters |
|---|-------|-------------------------|----------------|
| B1 | FRT used in schools for multiple purposes | "campus security, automated registration and student emotion detection" | Background context |
| B2 | Schools already have surveillance culture | "extensive cultures of monitoring and surveillance" | FRT builds on existing issues |
| B3 | Facial data is inescapable | "people are always connected to their faces" / unlike social media posts, cannot self-curate | Core concern—no control |
| B4 | Opt-out is meaningless | "system has to scan a student's face before it can recognise that they have opted out" | Paradox of consent |
| B5 | Schools enforce visibility | "dress codes that preclude students' faces being covered by hair, hoods" | Coercion is structural |
| B6 | Informed consent is inadequate | "complete sweeps of classrooms and corridors" required → opt-in/opt-out "counter-productive" | Consent cannot be meaningful |

### Argument Flow in Article B

```
B1 (context: FRT spreading) 
   ↓
B2 (schools already have surveillance) 
   ↓
B3 (facial data is unique—inescapable) 
   ↓
B4 + B5 (opt-out doesn't work + dress codes enforce visibility) 
   ↓
B6 (informed consent is inadequate)
```

### Teacher Comment

- Article B builds an **argument**, not a report of findings
- Each point reinforces the next → surveillance is inescapable → consent is impossible
- Key examples to paraphrase: "always connected to their faces," "scan before recognising opt-out"
