# Detailed Plan: Paragraph-by-Paragraph Outline

This outline provides all points, details, and flow guidance for writing the summary. **No complete sentences**—only notes, excerpts, and structure.

---

## Introduction (approx. 40–50 words)

### Content to Include

| Element | Source | Details/Excerpts to Paraphrase |
|---------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Background | B1/A1 | FRT increasingly used in schools; purposes: security, attendance, monitoring |
| Topic focus | Task | adoption of FRT in elementary/compulsory schools |
| Thesis | Synthesis | two perspectives: (1) parents support despite concerns (A), (2) critics warn about consent/surveillance (B) |

### Flow Guidance

```
[General context] → [Narrow to schools] → [Thesis: two contrasting views]
```

- Start broad: FRT now used in various public spaces
- Narrow: including schools for security, attendance
- Thesis: researchers and stakeholders hold different views—some supportive (parents), some critical (privacy/consent concerns)

### Excerpts for Paraphrasing (Introduction)

| From | Original | Paraphrase Direction |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| B abstract | "burgeoning integration of facial recognition... into compulsory schooling" | → FRT increasingly adopted in schools |
| B abstract | "campus security, automated registration and student emotion detection" | → used for security, attendance, monitoring |
| Task prompt | "Different views about the adoption of FRT... from researchers and other stakeholders" | → contrasting perspectives exist |

---

## Body Paragraph (approx. 150–180 words)

### Option: One Integrated Paragraph

**Topic sentence idea:** debate centres on perceived value vs. concerns about consent

### Cluster 1: Privacy Concerns and Consent

| Point | Source | Details/Excerpts | Flow |
|-------|--------|------------------|------|
| Parents have privacy concerns | A2 | DBVW score > neutral; "worried about disclosure of students' personal privacy" | Start with acknowledgment of concerns |
| BUT parents still support | A4/A5 | perceived value + continuance intention both > neutral | Transition: despite this... |
| Critics: concerns are valid | B3 | "people are always connected to their faces"; cannot self-curate | Contrast: however... |
| Consent is inadequate | B6 | "complete sweeps" required; opt-in/opt-out "counter-productive" | Consequence of B3 |

### Cluster 2: Value vs. Choice

| Point | Source | Details/Excerpts | Flow |
|-------|--------|------------------|------|
| Parents see FRT as valuable | A4 | perceived value high; willing to accept despite risks | Introduce parent perspective |
| Parents intend to continue | A5 | continuance intention; "valuable, so they intended to continue" | Support for A4 |
| BUT opt-out is meaningless | B4 | "scan a student's face before it can recognise that they have opted out" | Contrast: on the other hand... |
| Coercion in schools | B5 | dress codes prevent covering face; "makes it difficult to obscure faces" | Schools enforce visibility |

### Flow Guidance (Body)

```
[Topic sentence: debate = value vs. consent]
   ↓
[A2: parents have concerns] → [A4/A5: BUT still support, see value]
   ↓
[Transition: However/In contrast]
   ↓
[B3: concerns are valid—data inescapable] → [B6: consent inadequate]
   ↓
[B4/B5: opt-out meaningless, coercion in schools]
```

### Transition Words/Phrases to Use

| Purpose | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Introduce A | "According to Hong et al. (2022)..." / "Research by Hong et al. (2022) indicates..." |
| Concession | "Although...", "Despite...", "While..." |
| Contrast | "However,", "In contrast,", "On the other hand,", "Conversely," |
| Introduce B | "Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argue...", "According to Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020)..." |

### Excerpts for Paraphrasing (Body)

| From | Original | Paraphrase Direction |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| A discussion | "parents were worried about the disclosure of students' personal privacy" | → parents acknowledge privacy risks |
| A discussion | "although the parent respondents thought that the face recognition system had certain risks, they were willing to try technological innovation and they thought the system was valuable" | → despite concerns, parents support FRT due to perceived benefits |
| B discussion | "people are always connected to their faces" | → facial data cannot be separated from identity |
| B discussion | "no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they 'share'" | → students cannot control their data |
| B discussion | "system has to scan a student's face before it can recognise that they have opted out" | → opting out is paradoxical/ineffective |
| B discussion | "dress codes that preclude students' faces being covered" | → school rules enforce visibility |

---

## Conclusion (approx. 30–40 words)

### Content to Include

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Restate contrast | parents perceive value and support FRT ↔ critics raise concerns about consent and surveillance |
| No new information | do not add new points |
| Brief | 1–2 sentences only |

### Flow Guidance

```
[In summary / To conclude] → [Restate tension: support vs. concerns] → [End]
```

### Possible Structures

- "In summary, while [A perspective], [B perspective raises concerns about...]"
- "The debate over FRT in schools reflects a tension between [perceived value] and [consent/rights]"
