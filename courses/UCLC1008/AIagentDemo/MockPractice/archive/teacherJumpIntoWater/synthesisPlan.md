# Synthesis Plan: Linking Article A and Article B

This document maps connections between points from both articles and plans the structure for the summary.

## Point Connections: A ↔ B

| A Point | B Point | Connection Type | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| A2 (DBVW/privacy concerns) | B3 (inescapable facial data) | **Contrast** | A: parents worried BUT still support; B: concern is valid—data cannot be controlled |
| A2 (privacy concerns exist) | B6 (consent inadequate) | **Contrast** | A: concerns don't stop support; B: concerns should stop implementation |
| A4 (perceived value high) | B4 (opt-out meaningless) | **Tension** | A: parents see benefits; B: benefits come at cost of genuine choice |
| A5 (continuance intention) | B5 (coercion in schools) | **Tension** | A: parents want to continue; B: students have no choice either way |
| A1 (China context) | B1 (general school context) | **Background** | Both discuss FRT adoption in schools—can merge for intro |

## Synthesis Strategy

### Thesis Statement Elements

- Topic: FRT adoption in schools
- Preview: contrasting perspectives (support vs. concerns)
- Framing: parents' perceived value vs. students' lack of consent

### Key Contrast to Highlight

| Article A | Article B |
|-----------|-----------|
| Parents acknowledge risks but support FRT | Critics argue risks are too serious |
| Focus on **perceived value** (benefits) | Focus on **consent** (rights) |
| **Stakeholder:** parents | **Stakeholder:** students |
| **Stance:** supportive | **Stance:** critical |

## Structure Plan

### Introduction
- **Background:** FRT increasingly used in schools (from B1, can also draw from A1)
- **Thesis:** two contrasting perspectives—parents support FRT despite privacy concerns (A); critics warn about inescapable surveillance and lack of consent (B)

### Body Paragraph(s)

**Option 1: Two separate paragraphs**
- Body 1: Article A (support)—parents value FRT, willing to continue despite risks
- Body 2: Article B (concerns)—surveillance inescapable, consent meaningless

**Option 2: One integrated paragraph (recommended for synthesis)**
- Topic sentence: debate centres on perceived value vs. consent
- Point cluster 1: A2 + B3 → privacy concerns exist; A says parents still support, B says concerns are valid because data is inescapable
- Point cluster 2: A4/A5 + B4/B6 → A says parents see value and want to continue; B says opt-out is meaningless, consent inadequate

### Conclusion
- Brief restatement: tension between stakeholders (parents vs. students) and priorities (value vs. rights)
- No new information

## Point Clusters for Body

| Cluster | A Points | B Points | Focus |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| Cluster 1 | A2 (privacy concerns) | B3 (inescapable data), B6 (consent inadequate) | Privacy and consent |
| Cluster 2 | A4 (perceived value), A5 (continuance intention) | B4 (opt-out meaningless), B5 (coercion) | Value vs. choice |
