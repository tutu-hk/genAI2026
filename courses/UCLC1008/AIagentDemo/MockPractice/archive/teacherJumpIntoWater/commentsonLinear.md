we need to explore the connections among the points found in A and B as well as details 

since the points are listed linearly, currently we do not pay enough attention to the connectedness of the points 

but when we write a summary of two article excerpts, we need to show such connections 

I think the current points in article A did not capture the relationship among the points 
we need to revisit the abstract 
this is where different points are connected 

also the points in article B seems to lack examples or data 
we need to write a linearPoints02.md to address this and enhance the outline 

then take into account linearPoints02.md
we need synthesisPlan.md 

here we need to bring the points from A and B together 
A1 ... linked to B3 ... 
A2 ... linked B5

so we need to decide what to cover in the intro 
what are the key point cluter to include in the middle paragraph 
what is cover in the conclusion 

we want detailedPlan.md here we have all the points to cover in each paragraph together important details all coming from two source texts

we want the outline to be so detailed that it also provide guidance on how to write up the paragraphs(offer excerpts and explanation of the flow)

do not write complete sentences
