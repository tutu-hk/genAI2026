# Linear Points: Article A and Article B

This document lists the main points and supporting details from each excerpt in a linear form—**before** considering how to synthesise them.

## Article A – Hong et al. (2022)

**Title:** Supporting schools to use face recognition systems: a continuance intention perspective of elementary school parents in China

### Key Points to Cover

1. **Study context and purpose**
   - Empirical study examining parents' attitudes toward FRT in elementary schools
   - Collected 380 responses from parents in Xuzhou, China
   - Investigated how technological innovativeness and DBVW (dangerous beliefs in virtual world) affect perceived value and intention to continue using FRT

2. **Parents have privacy concerns but still support FRT**
   - DBVW score (3.865) > neutral level (3.000) → parents worried about privacy disclosure
   - Parents have cautious attitudes toward new technologies
   - *Teacher comment: This shows awareness of risks*

3. **Parents are open to technological innovation**
   - Technological innovativeness score (3.796) > neutral level (3.000)
   - Parents tend to accept new technology

4. **Parents perceive FRT as valuable**
   - Perceived value score (3.919) > neutral level (3.000)
   - Parents generally recognise the value of FRT in schools

5. **Parents intend to continue supporting FRT use**
   - Continuance intention score (3.776) > neutral level (3.000)
   - Parents prefer to continue using FRT at campus entrance

6. **Overall finding (key takeaway)**
   - Despite recognising risks, parents are willing to try the technology
   - They see it as valuable → intend to continue using it
   - *Teacher comment: This is the main claim for your summary*

### Teacher Hints for Article A

- Focus on the **overall finding** (point 6) as the main claim
- You don't need to include all the numerical data—summarise the pattern
- Paraphrase: "Parents support FRT despite privacy concerns because they value its benefits"
- The abstract and discussion align—discussion expands on the abstract's findings

## Article B – Andrejevic & Selwyn (2020)

**Title:** Facial recognition technology in schools: critical questions and concerns

### Key Points to Cover

1. **Context: FRT is increasingly used in schools**
   - Used for security, automated attendance, emotion detection
   - Schools already have cultures of monitoring and surveillance
   - *Teacher comment: This can be used as background in your introduction*

2. **The article raises critical concerns about FRT in schools**
   - Questions whether FRT should be allowed in schools
   - Warns of divisive, authoritarian, and oppressive outcomes
   - *Teacher comment: This is the overall stance—critical/questioning*

3. **The inescapable nature of facial data**
   - Unlike other data (social media posts), facial data cannot be controlled by students
   - People are always connected to their faces
   - Students cannot self-curate or restrict what they "share"

4. **Opt-out is not a real option**
   - Students cannot meaningfully opt out of FRT systems
   - Opting out renders the system ineffective
   - The system must scan a face before it knows someone has opted out
   - *Teacher comment: This is a key concern—lack of genuine choice*

5. **Coercion is especially acute in schools**
   - Dress codes prevent students from covering their faces
   - Schools enforce rules that make surveillance easier
   - Students cannot obscure their faces from cameras

6. **Informed consent is inadequate**
   - FRT systems require complete sweeps of classrooms and corridors
   - Opt-in/opt-out approaches are counter-productive
   - *Teacher comment: This challenges the idea that consent can be meaningful in schools*

### Teacher Hints for Article B

- Focus on **concerns about consent and inescapability** as the main claim
- The article is argumentative/critical, not empirical
- Paraphrase: "FRT in schools raises concerns because students cannot opt out, and surveillance is inescapable"
- Key contrast with Article A: While A reports parents support FRT, B warns about ethical/consent issues

## Summary: Points at a Glance

| Article | Stance | Main Claim |
|---------|--------|------------|
| A (Hong et al., 2022) | Supportive (based on data) | Parents support FRT in schools despite privacy concerns because they value its benefits |
| B (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020) | Critical/Questioning | FRT in schools raises serious concerns—students cannot opt out, and surveillance is inescapable |

## Next Step

Combine these linear points into a synthesised summary:
- **Introduction:** Background on FRT in schools + thesis (contrasting views)
- **Body:** Integrate claims from both articles (support vs. concerns)
- **Conclusion:** Brief summary of the tension between perceived value and ethical concerns
