## INTRODUCTION (Write 3 sentences, approx. 40–50 words)

### Sentence 1: Background (general context)

**What to write:** Introduce FRT and its growing use in public spaces, including schools.

**Excerpt to paraphrase (from Article B abstract):**
> "Facial recognition technology is now being introduced across various aspects of public life. This includes the burgeoning integration of facial recognition... into compulsory schooling to address issues such as campus security, automated registration and student emotion detection."

**How to paraphrase:** Combine the ideas → FRT is increasingly used in schools for purposes like security and attendance.

**Citation needed?** No citation needed for general background. You may optionally cite if you want to be thorough.

**Example sentence frame:**
> Facial recognition technology (FRT) is increasingly being adopted in schools for purposes such as __________ and __________.

---

### Sentence 2: Topic focus (narrow to the debate)

**What to write:** State that there are different views on FRT adoption in schools.

**Excerpt to paraphrase (from task prompt):**
> "Different views about the adoption of FRT in elementary schools from researchers and other stakeholders have been seen in the research literature and media."

**How to paraphrase:** Researchers and stakeholders hold contrasting views on FRT in schools.

**Citation needed?** No.

**Example sentence frame:**
> However, researchers and stakeholders hold different views on whether FRT should be adopted in schools.

---

### Sentence 3: Thesis statement (preview both perspectives)

**What to write:** State the two perspectives you will discuss—(1) parents support FRT despite concerns (Article A) and (2) critics warn about consent and surveillance (Article B).

**How to paraphrase:** Combine the main claims from both articles into one thesis.

**Citation needed?** No (this is your own synthesis).

**Example sentence frame:**
> This summary examines two perspectives: one suggests that parents support FRT despite privacy concerns, while the other raises critical concerns about student consent and surveillance.

---

## BODY PARAGRAPH (Write 6–8 sentences, approx. 150–180 words)

### Sentence 4: Topic sentence (introduce the debate)

**What to write:** State that the debate centres on perceived value versus concerns about consent.

**Citation needed?** No (this is your framing).

**Example sentence frame:**
> The debate over FRT in schools centres on its perceived value to parents versus concerns about student consent.

---

### Sentence 5: Article A—parents have concerns (acknowledge)

**What to write:** Parents are aware of privacy risks.

**Excerpt to paraphrase (from Article A discussion):**
> "The results indicate that the average score of parents' DBVW is 3.865, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that the parents were worried about the disclosure of students' personal privacy."

**How to paraphrase:** Parents in the study expressed concerns about the disclosure of students' personal data.

**Citation needed?** YES → cite Hong et al. (2022)

**Example sentence frame:**
> Hong et al. (2022) found that parents were concerned about the potential disclosure of students' personal privacy.

---

### Sentence 6: Article A—BUT parents still support FRT (contrast)

**What to write:** Despite concerns, parents see FRT as valuable and support its continued use.

**Excerpt to paraphrase (from Article A discussion):**
> "On the whole, although the parent respondents thought that the face recognition system had certain risks, they were willing to try technological innovation and they thought the system was valuable, so they intended to continue using it."

**How to paraphrase:** Despite these concerns, parents valued FRT and intended to continue supporting its use.

**Citation needed?** YES → continue citing Hong et al. (2022) or use information-prominent style.

**Example sentence frame:**
> Despite these concerns, the parents perceived FRT as valuable and expressed a willingness to continue supporting its use in schools (Hong et al., 2022).

---

### Sentence 7: Transition to Article B (contrast)

**What to write:** Introduce the critical perspective from Article B.

**How to write:** Use a contrast transition word (However, In contrast, On the other hand).

**Citation needed?** YES → introduce Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020)

**Example sentence frame:**
> However, Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) raise critical concerns about FRT in schools.

---

### Sentence 8: Article B—facial data is inescapable

**What to write:** Unlike other forms of data, facial data cannot be controlled by students.

**Excerpt to paraphrase (from Article B discussion):**
> "Unlike other forms of personal data (i.e., any piece of data connected to an individual's name), facial data lends itself to constant and permanent surveillance. In short, people are always connected to their faces. Thus, unlike social media posts or interactions with school learning management systems, there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they 'share'."

**How to paraphrase:** Students cannot control their facial data because they are always connected to their faces—unlike social media, they cannot choose what to share.

**Citation needed?** Continue with Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) or use information-prominent style.

**Example sentence frame:**
> They argue that facial data is inescapable because students are always connected to their faces and cannot control what information they share (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

---

### Sentence 9: Article B—opt-out is meaningless

**What to write:** Opting out of FRT is not a real choice because the system must scan a face before recognising an opt-out.

**Excerpt to paraphrase (from Article B discussion):**
> "Even if opt-out protocols are in place, the system has to scan a student's face before it can recognise that they have opted out."

**How to paraphrase:** Opting out is ineffective because the system scans the student's face before it can recognise the opt-out.

**Citation needed?** Continue with Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020).

**Example sentence frame:**
> Furthermore, opting out is ineffective because the system must scan a student's face before it can recognise that they have opted out (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

---

### Sentence 10: Article B—coercion in schools (optional, if word count allows)

**What to write:** Schools enforce rules (like dress codes) that make surveillance easier.

**Excerpt to paraphrase (from Article B discussion):**
> "For example, most schools enforce dress codes that preclude students' faces being covered by hair, hoods or other obtrusions. This makes it difficult for students to obscure their faces from surveillance cameras."

**How to paraphrase:** School dress codes prevent students from covering their faces, making surveillance unavoidable.

**Citation needed?** Continue with Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020).

**Example sentence frame:**
> Additionally, school dress codes prevent students from covering their faces, making surveillance unavoidable (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

---

### Sentence 11: Article B—consent is inadequate (wrap up concerns)

**What to write:** Informed consent is inadequate because FRT systems require complete monitoring.

**Excerpt to paraphrase (from Article B discussion):**
> "The systems being deployed in schools for security and attendance purposes rely on complete sweeps of classrooms and corridors in order to operate. This renders 'opt-in' and 'opt-out' approaches counter-productive from the point of view of the system provider."

**How to paraphrase:** FRT systems require complete sweeps of classrooms, making informed consent impossible.

**Citation needed?** End with Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020).

**Example sentence frame:**
> This renders informed consent inadequate, as FRT systems require complete monitoring of classrooms and corridors to function (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

---

## CONCLUSION (Write 1–2 sentences, approx. 30–40 words)

### Sentence 12: Restate the contrast

**What to write:** Summarise the tension between the two perspectives—parents see value, but critics warn about consent.

**Citation needed?** No (this is your synthesis). You may optionally cite both at the end.

**Example sentence frame:**
> In conclusion, while parents may perceive FRT as valuable and support its use (Hong et al., 2022), critics caution that students cannot meaningfully consent to constant surveillance (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

**OR (simpler version):**
> In summary, the adoption of FRT in schools remains debated, with supporters emphasising its value and critics highlighting concerns about consent and surveillance.
