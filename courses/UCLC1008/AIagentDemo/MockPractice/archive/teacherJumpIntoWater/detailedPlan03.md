## INTRODUCTION (3 sentences, approx. 40–50 words)

### Sentence 1: Background

**Purpose:** Introduce FRT and its growing use in schools

**Excerpt to paraphrase:**
> "Facial recognition technology is now being introduced across various aspects of public life. This includes the burgeoning integration of facial recognition... into compulsory schooling to address issues such as campus security, automated registration and student emotion detection."

**Paraphrase direction:** FRT increasingly used in schools → purposes: security, attendance, monitoring

**Citation:** No (general background)

---

### Sentence 2: Topic focus

**Purpose:** State that different views exist on FRT in schools

**Excerpt to paraphrase:**
> "Different views about the adoption of FRT in elementary schools from researchers and other stakeholders have been seen in the research literature and media."

**Paraphrase direction:** contrasting views from researchers and stakeholders

**Citation:** No

---

### Sentence 3: Thesis statement

**Purpose:** Preview both perspectives—(1) parents support FRT despite concerns (A), (2) critics warn about consent/surveillance (B)

**Paraphrase direction:** combine main claims → one supports, one warns

**Citation:** No (your synthesis)

---

## BODY PARAGRAPH (6–8 sentences, approx. 150–180 words)

### Sentence 4: Topic sentence

**Purpose:** Frame the debate—perceived value vs. consent concerns

**Citation:** No (your framing)

---

### Sentence 5: Article A—parents have concerns

**Purpose:** Acknowledge parents are aware of privacy risks

**Excerpt to paraphrase:**
> "The results indicate that the average score of parents' DBVW is 3.865, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that the parents were worried about the disclosure of students' personal privacy."

**Paraphrase direction:** parents concerned about → privacy disclosure / personal data

**Citation:** YES → Hong et al. (2022)

---

### Sentence 6: Article A—BUT parents still support

**Purpose:** Despite concerns, parents value FRT and support continued use

**Excerpt to paraphrase:**
> "On the whole, although the parent respondents thought that the face recognition system had certain risks, they were willing to try technological innovation and they thought the system was valuable, so they intended to continue using it."

**Paraphrase direction:** despite risks → perceive value → intend to continue

**Citation:** YES → Hong et al. (2022)

---

### Sentence 7: Transition to Article B

**Purpose:** Introduce critical perspective with contrast transition

**Transition words:** However / In contrast / On the other hand

**Citation:** YES → Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020)

---

### Sentence 8: Article B—facial data is inescapable

**Purpose:** Unlike other data, facial data cannot be controlled

**Excerpt to paraphrase:**
> "Unlike other forms of personal data... facial data lends itself to constant and permanent surveillance. In short, people are always connected to their faces. Thus... there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they 'share'."

**Paraphrase direction:** facial data ≠ social media → always connected to face → cannot control

**Citation:** YES → Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020)

---

### Sentence 9: Article B—opt-out is meaningless

**Purpose:** Opting out doesn't work—system scans before recognising opt-out

**Excerpt to paraphrase:**
> "Even if opt-out protocols are in place, the system has to scan a student's face before it can recognise that they have opted out."

**Paraphrase direction:** opt-out ineffective → must scan first → paradox

**Citation:** YES → Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020)

---

### Sentence 10: Article B—coercion in schools (optional)

**Purpose:** Schools enforce rules that make surveillance easier

**Excerpt to paraphrase:**
> "For example, most schools enforce dress codes that preclude students' faces being covered by hair, hoods or other obtrusions. This makes it difficult for students to obscure their faces from surveillance cameras."

**Paraphrase direction:** dress codes → faces exposed → cannot hide from cameras

**Citation:** YES → Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020)

---

### Sentence 11: Article B—consent is inadequate

**Purpose:** Informed consent impossible due to system requirements

**Excerpt to paraphrase:**
> "The systems being deployed in schools for security and attendance purposes rely on complete sweeps of classrooms and corridors in order to operate. This renders 'opt-in' and 'opt-out' approaches counter-productive."

**Paraphrase direction:** complete sweeps required → opt-in/opt-out doesn't work → consent inadequate

**Citation:** YES → Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020)

---

## CONCLUSION (1–2 sentences, approx. 30–40 words)

### Sentence 12: Restate the contrast

**Purpose:** Summarise tension—parents see value vs. critics warn about consent

**Paraphrase direction:** parents perceive value + support ↔ critics warn consent/surveillance concerns

**Citation:** Optional (can cite both or neither)

---
