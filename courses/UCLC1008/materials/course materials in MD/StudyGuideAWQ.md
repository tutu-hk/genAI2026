## Part 1: How to Read and Select Main Ideas from Journal Article Excerpts

---

### Step 1: Analyse the Title

- **Identify the Subject Matter** (broad topic)
- **Understand the Context** (specific focus of the paper)
- **Predict the Stance** (based on word choice and connotations)

| Stance | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Support/Endorse** | The author agrees with a specific idea, theory or approach |
| **Promote/Advocate** | The author actively argues for adopting a specific policy |
| **Reject/Refute** | The author argues against a specific idea or theory |
| **Doubt** | The author expresses scepticism/uncertainty about the validity/generalisability of a specific idea or finding |
| **Question/Challenge** | The author raises critical points or identifies problems of a specific idea |

#### Example: Article A

**Title:** Supporting schools to use face recognition systems: A continuance intention perspective of elementary school parents in China

| Element | Analysis |
|---------|----------|
| Subject Matter | Face recognition systems |
| Context | Continuance intention perspective, Elementary school parents in China |
| Stance | **Support** — "Supporting" |

#### Example: Article B

**Title:** Facial recognition technology in schools: Critical questions and concerns

| Element | Analysis |
|---------|----------|
| Subject Matter | Facial recognition technology |
| Context | Schools |
| Stance | **Doubt** — "critical questions", "concerns" |

---

### Step 2: Study the Abstract

- **Relate Background Information** to the Subject Matter and Context
- **Locate the Purpose** (Purpose Statement) for the Stance
- **Skip Methods** (methodological details) — for empirical papers
- **Focus on Key Findings** (for empirical papers) or **Key Arguments** (for theoretical papers)
- **Examine Implications/Conclusion** to confirm the Stance

#### Example: Article A (Abstract Analysis)

| Abstract Text | Analysis |
|---------------|----------|
| "A great deal of attention has been focused on technological innovation, for example, face recognition, which has been used in some countries in various fields. Nonetheless, there has been little attention paid to parents' acceptance of the use of face recognition systems on campus." | **Background Information:** Technological innovation → face recognition (FR) → various use of FR → parents' acceptance of FR on campus [Subject Matter + Context] |
| "To address this gap in the literature, this study examined how different degrees of technological innovativeness and dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW) influence parents' perceived value of using and intention to continue supporting schools' use of face recognition systems." | **Purpose Statement:** Fill a research niche. This study focuses on the relationship between technological innovativeness and DBVW, and parents' perceived value of continuing to support schools' use of FR [Stance: Support] |
| "This study adopted snowball sampling to collect data through questionnaires, and received 380 valid responses from parents living in Xuzhou, China. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to analyse the data..." | **Methodological Details** (skip) |
| "...with results indicating that: (1) DBVW was negatively related to perceived value; (2) technological innovativeness was positively related to perceived value; and (3) perceived value was positively related to continuance intention to use face recognition systems." | **Key Findings** |
| "The results suggest that parents support the use of face recognition systems in elementary schools; thus, such systems can be adopted by other elementary schools in other areas." | **Implications:** The author supports the use of FR and promotes it to other schools [Stance: Support] |

#### Example: Article B (Abstract Analysis)

| Abstract Text | Analysis |
|---------------|----------|
| "Facial recognition technology is now being introduced across various aspects of public life. This includes the burgeoning integration of facial recognition and facial detection into compulsory schooling to address issues such as campus security, automated registration and student emotion detection. So far, these technologies have largely been seen as routine additions to school systems with already extensive cultures of monitoring and surveillance." | **Background Information:** Public life → schools → use of FRT in schools, e.g., monitoring and surveillance [Subject Matter + Context] |
| "While critical commentators are beginning to question the pedagogical limitations of facially driven learning, this article contends that school-based facial recognition presents a number of other social challenges and concerns that merit specific attention." | **Purpose Statement:** Contrast other commentators' focus on pedagogical limitations. This article focuses on social challenges and concerns [Stance: Doubt] |
| "This includes the likelihood of facial recognition technology altering the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian and oppressive lines." | **Key Arguments** |
| "Against this background, the article considers whether or not a valid case can ever be made for allowing this form of technology in schools." | **Conclusion:** The author uses "can ever" to introduce scepticism. The word "ever" may imply that the author sees significant challenges—even impossibility—in justifying the technology. [Stance: Doubt] |

---

### Step 3: Examine Section Headings

- **Connect Headings** to the paper's Context and Stance (how they structure the argument)

#### Example: Article B (Section Heading)

**Heading:** Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools

> "These questions over diminished notions of pedagogy and consent are important. Yet, at this point, we would like to argue that there are a number of additional issues and concerns that cast further serious doubt upon the implementation of facial recognition technologies in schools. In brief, the following points of contention might be raised:"

**Analysis:** Pedagogy and consent → additional issues and concerns [Subject Matter + Context] [Stance: Doubt]

---

### Step 4: Identify and Analyse Topic Sentence (TS) and Concluding Sentence

- **Relate TS to Key Findings/Arguments**
- **Distinguish between:**
  - **Authors' Claims** (for the Stance, supporting the main arguments)
  - **Opponents' Claims** (against the Stance, counterarguments or critiques)
- **Focus on Explanations** (how Claims are logically supported and linked to Evidence)
- **Determine if each paragraph includes a concluding sentence** which connects with the Key Findings/Arguments presented in the TS. (Note: some paragraphs may include concluding sentences, while some may not.)
- **Omit detailed/specific Evidence/Data** (because examples/data do not speak for the Stance)

#### Example: Article A (Paragraph Analysis)

| Text | Analysis |
|------|----------|
| "Although implicit and explicit attitudes are different, they can both affect behaviours, and individuals' attitude can promote the value perception before performing a behaviour (Kaiser et al., 2021). In line with this, the present study explored parents' DBVW and technological innovativeness in the value perception of the use of face-recognition systems, and continuous intention to use such systems as a research framework." | **Topic Sentence:** The author explained the use of value perception to find out parents' continuous intention to use FRT. |
| "The results indicate that the average score of parents' DBVW is 3.865, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that the parents were worried about the disclosure of students' personal privacy..." | **Data #1 → Finding #1** |
| "The average score of parents' technological innovativeness is 3.796, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that the parent respondents tended to accept new technology..." | **Data #2 → Finding #2** |
| "The average score of parents' perceived value is 3.919, which is much higher than the neutral level (3.000), indicating that the parents generally recognise the value of face recognition systems..." | **Data #3 → Finding #3** |
| "The average score of CIU is 3.776, which is higher than the neutral level (3.000), indicating that the respondents generally preferred to continue using the face recognition system at the campus entrance." | **Data #4 → Finding #4** |
| "On the whole, although the parent respondents thought that the face recognition system had certain risks, they were willing to try technological innovation and they thought the system was valuable, so they intended to continue using it." | **Author's Claim:** Despite risks, the author generally supports the continuous use of FRT [Stance: Support] |
| "According to the results of the path analysis coefficient test, the DBVW was negatively correlated with perceived value, supporting H1... The results of this study indicate that there was a significant negative correlation between users' anxiety about face recognition technology and their perceived usefulness... Therefore, this study suggests that the higher the parents' DBVW, the lower the value they perceived." | **Finding #5** + Author's elaboration + Author's interpretation |
| "The results of the path analysis coefficient test revealed that technological innovativeness has a positive correlation with perceived value, supporting H2... This study found that the higher the technological innovativeness, the higher the perceived value." | **Finding #6** + Author's elaboration + Author's interpretation |

#### Example: Article B (Paragraph Analysis)

**Sub-heading:** The inescapable nature of school-based facial recognition

| Text | Analysis |
|------|----------|
| "Another point of concern is the inescapability of facial monitoring within school contexts." | **Topic Sentence:** Echoes Sub-heading |
| "Unlike other forms of personal data (i.e., any piece of data connected to an individual's name), facial data lends itself to constant and permanent surveillance." | **Explanation 1:** Constant surveillance |
| "In short, people are always connected to their faces. Thus, unlike social media posts or interactions with school learning management systems, there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they 'share'." | **Explanation 2:** No self-curation option |
| "While students might be able to opt-out from facial detection elements of their school's learning systems (for example, the use of eye-tracking or facial thermal imaging for learning analytics), there is no right to decline to participate in 'non-cooperative' facial recognition systems (indeed, any opt-out effectively renders campus facial recognition systems ineffective)." | **Explanation 3:** Opt-out limitations |
| "While such coercion applies to the use of facial recognition in all public spaces, it is especially acute in schools. For example, most schools enforce dress codes that preclude students' faces being covered by hair, hoods or other obtrusions. This makes it difficult for students to obscure their faces from surveillance cameras." | **Explanation 4:** Coercion in public spaces (+ Example) |
| "This also raises the inadequacy of any promise of 'informed consent' regarding school facial recognition systems. The systems being deployed in schools for security and attendance purposes rely on complete sweeps of classrooms and corridors in order to operate." | **Explanation 5:** Inadequately informed consent |
| "This renders 'opt-in' and 'opt-out' approaches counter-productive from the point of view of the system provider. Even if opt-out protocols are in place, the system has to scan a student's face before it can recognise that they have opted out." | **Explanation 6:** Opt-in/opt-out impracticality |

**Summary:** All six explanations address the inescapable nature of FRT in schools. The **Key Arguments** (authoritarian and oppressive) are addressed by Explanations 1–6.

|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **1. Background** (setting the scene) | • Contextualise your summary by extracting or synthesising the Context (background) from the provided excerpts.<br>• Introduce a discussion framework, such as:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- A problem-solution approach<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Areas of controversy or debate | "Facial recognition technology (FRT) has rapidly expanded into various sectors, including education, where it is adopted for purposes like campus security."<br><br>"However, scholarly opinion remains divided on its adoption in educational settings." [Neutral]<br><br>"However, its adoption in schools remains a contentious issue among scholars." [Controversy]<br><br>"Nevertheless, academic consensus on its implementation in schools has yet to emerge." [Formal and academic] |
| **2. Thesis Statement** | • Provide a concise preview of the summary<br>• Highlight common or contrasting Key Findings or Arguments from the excerpts to address the assignment topic. | "This paper examines key arguments for and against FRT in schools, focussing on parental acceptance, while contending that its adoption raises social challenges requiring critical attention."<br><br>"The following discussion presents contrastive perspectives on school-based FRT, first examining parental support followed by emerging social challenges." |

### Paragraph 2: Body Paragraph

| Component | What to Include | Expressions/Examples |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **1. Topic Sentence** | • Introduce a specific theme (e.g., moral) or main idea of the Key Findings or Arguments shared across both articles.<br>• Compare similarities and/or differences between authors' perspectives<br>• **Synthesis of Arguments:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Group similar arguments from different authors under a shared aspect to address the specific theme/main idea<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use in-text citations (including secondary citations) to attribute ideas correctly | "The adoption of facial recognition technology (FRT) in schools has sparked significant moral debate, with scholars raising concerns about privacy violations (Author A, 2023), threats to student autonomy (Author B, 2022; Author C, 2017), and systemic biases in algorithmic surveillance (Author D, 2021). However, Author E (2023) challenges these objections, arguing that FRT's potential to enhance students' safety justifies its adoption despite ethical concerns."<br><br>*Note: Synthesising is applied to compare similarities and differences between various authors' perspectives.* |
| **2. Explanations of Claims or Arguments** (corresponding to the specific theme/main idea in the Topic Sentence) | • When highlighting differences or opposing views among authors, use contrastive connectives (e.g., "Conversely,") or suitable reporting verbs/phrases (e.g., "This view is challenged by...")<br>• Focus on identifying Claims and Explanations but omit detailed Evidence<br>• Use in-text citations (including secondary citations) to attribute ideas correctly | **Similarities on Concerns:**<br>- *Privacy:* "Author A argues that FRT violates students' right to obscurity in learning environments because..."<br>- *Autonomy:* "Author B and Author C highlight the lack of voluntary consent, especially for minors since..." (Note: Synthesis occurs in Autonomy.)<br>- *Bias:* "Author D demonstrates how FRT disproportionately misidentifies marginalised students, exacerbating inequities by..."<br><br>**Difference in Challenge:**<br>- *Safety:* "Author E contends that schools implementing FRT have an ethical obligation to prioritise student safety, arguing that the protective benefits of surveillance outweigh potential privacy trade-offs." |

*Note: Authors A–E above are for illustrative purposes only. In practice, you must report the actual author's name.*
