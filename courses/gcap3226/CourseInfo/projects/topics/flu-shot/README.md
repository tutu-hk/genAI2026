# Flu Shot — Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (Group 1)

## Background

The Hong Kong government runs a **seasonal influenza vaccination programme** and related public health campaigns to reduce flu-related illness and death. Uptake among target groups (e.g. elderly, children, chronic patients) has been a policy concern; data on eligible populations, participation rates, and campaign effectiveness are not always fully in the public domain.

Past course work has shown that writing to the **Department of Health** (e.g. under the Code on Access to Information) can yield data on eligible numbers (e.g. 1.5M / 1.9M) and participation rates, which can then be used to assess and improve the programme.

**Relevant bodies:** Department of Health, Centre for Health Protection, Legco Panel on Health Services.

## Past project work (Fall 2025)

Team 1 (GCAP 3226 Fall 2025) delivered a full project on **flu vaccination campaigns**, **school report cards**, and **data-driven campaign planning**. Reusable elements:

- **Government enquiries:** Concise DoH request (school vaccination participation by season, data collection methods, eHealth integration); Education Bureau and Health Bureau drafts for school data and eHealth linkage.
- **Data requirements:** Structured list for CHP, HA, Census (surveillance, demographics, vaccination, environmental) to support regression or simulation.
- **School vaccination report card:** Regression of URTI absenteeism on vaccination rate; leaderboard and “Protection Score”; accountability levers (EDB, SDA, principal appraisal).
- **Vaccine effectiveness:** Test-negative design using eHealth-verified vaccination and lab results (protocol and governance notes).
- **Report structure:** Report card + VE + data governance gap analysis; methodology memos and synthetic data/figures.

See **[past-project-fall2025.md](past-project-fall2025.md)** for a concise summary, templates, and data/tools list.

## Value for the community

- **Transparency:** Making uptake and targeting data more visible helps the public and Legco assess whether resources are well used and whether campaigns reach the right groups.
- **Evidence-based improvement:** Clear data supports recommendations (e.g. on outreach, venue placement, communication) that can increase vaccination uptake and reduce flu-related harm.
- **Accountability:** Documenting how decisions are (or are not) data-informed encourages more data-driven public health policy and sets a precedent for other programmes.
