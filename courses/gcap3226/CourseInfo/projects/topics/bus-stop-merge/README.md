# Bus Stop Merge — Real-Time API and Bus Stop Optimization (Group 7)

## Background

This project focuses on **public transport data**, **bus stop utilization**, and **placement optimization** in Hong Kong. Government and operators make decisions on routes, stop locations, and real-time information; the extent to which these are informed by open data and systematic analysis is a focus.

Past course examples (e.g. bus stop naming confusion — two “St. Martin” stops) show that targeted engagement and data can lead to concrete improvements (e.g. disambiguation). Broader use of real-time API data and optimization tools could support better service design.

**Relevant bodies:** Transport Department, franchised bus operators, Legco Panel on Transport.

## Past project work (Fall 2025)

Team 6 (GCAP 3226 Fall 2025) delivered a full project on **real-time API data analysis**, **TD decision-making evaluation**, and **bus stop placement principles**. Reusable elements:

- **Government enquiry:** Template for Transport Department under the Code on Access to Information (ridership, SOPs, evaluation criteria).
- **Real-time API:** Rush-hour bus tracking (7–9 AM, 5–7 PM), nearby-stop spatial analysis, queue and arrival analysis.
- **Math/simulation:** Spatial optimization (distance + cost; accessibility and coverage constraints), passenger flow dynamics, scenarios (baseline, conservative, aggressive, hybrid). Case study: St. Martin / Chong San Road (52 m apart).
- **Report structure:** API data → TD process → placement principles → mathematical models → recommendations.

See **[past-project-fall2025.md](past-project-fall2025.md)** for a concise summary, templates, and data/tools list.

## Value for the community

- **Better transport experience:** Data-driven stop placement and information can reduce confusion, waiting time, and overcrowding.
- **Open data and innovation:** Demonstrating uses of API and open data can encourage more release of transport data for public benefit.
- **Accountability:** Showing how data is (or could be) used in route and stop decisions supports more transparent, evidence-based transport policy.
