# Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme (Group 5)

## Background

The **CDCC pilot** is a primary healthcare scheme for chronic disease management through **public–private partnership**. It aims to improve access and outcomes for people with chronic conditions; success depends on data collection, outcomes measurement, and how data is used to adjust the scheme.

Key questions: What data is collected from participants and providers? How are outcomes defined and reported? How does the government use this data in policy decisions (e.g. scaling up, eligibility, pricing)?

**Relevant bodies:** Food and Health Bureau / Health Bureau, Department of Health, participating private providers, Legco Panel on Health Services.

## Value for the community

- **Primary care reform:** Evidence from the pilot can inform whether and how to expand co-care models, benefiting people with chronic conditions and reducing pressure on hospitals.
- **Equity and access:** Data on who participates and outcomes by group can highlight gaps and support more equitable design.
- **Data governance:** Scrutinizing how pilot data is collected, shared, and used can improve accountability and set standards for future healthcare data use.
