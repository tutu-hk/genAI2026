# eMPF — Electronic Mandatory Provident Fund (Group 4)

## Background

The **eMPF platform** is a government-led digital transformation for the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) system, aimed at streamlining pension fund management for employers, employees, and trustees. Policy and design choices (e.g. user flows, data portability, governance) have long-term effects on millions of Hong Kong people’s retirement savings.

Key questions: How is user adoption and satisfaction measured? What data on platform usage and governance is available? To what extent are design and policy decisions informed by data?

**Relevant bodies:** Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA), Legco Panel on Financial Affairs, relevant bureaux.

## Value for the community

- **Pension governance:** Transparency on adoption, usability, and governance helps ensure the platform serves members and supports retirement security.
- **User empowerment:** Data on barriers to use and satisfaction can inform improvements that make it easier for people to manage their MPF.
- **Accountability:** Documenting how data informs eMPF decisions supports better digital governance and sets expectations for other government digital services.
