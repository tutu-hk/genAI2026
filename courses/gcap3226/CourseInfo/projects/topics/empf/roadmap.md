# eMPF — Project Roadmap

Actionable steps to pursue this project, aligned with [enhancedApproaches.md](../enhancedApproaches.md) and [projectWorkflow.html](../projectWorkflow.html). For each step, **AI agent can help** with execution; **human knowledge workers** set direction, judge quality, and steer.

---

## Step 1: Identify a government decision

**Actionable steps:** Choose a concrete decision (e.g. eMPF platform design, user onboarding, data portability, governance rules). Align with SDGs and course themes.

- **AI agent can help:** Search Legco.gov.hk and gov.hk for eMPF, MPFA, pension; list relevant meetings and papers; draft a short list of candidate decisions.
- **Human steers:** Decide which decision is most concrete and feasible to investigate; confirm alignment with group interest and course objectives.

---

## Step 2: Review the decision — room for improvement

**Actionable steps:** Document how the decision is controversial or disputable (e.g. adoption data, usability, transparency of governance). Frame as “room for improvement.”

- **AI agent can help:** Summarise Legco debates, news, or reports on eMPF; suggest possible gaps; draft a one-page “issues” list.
- **Human steers:** Judge which gaps are most relevant and constructive; set the tone and scope.

---

## Step 3: Search and curate public information

**Actionable steps:** Collect government and Legco documents on eMPF. Focus on decision-making process and how usage/governance data is managed. Use the government telephone directory for staff contacts.

- **AI agent can help:** Search and fetch Legco/gov.hk links; extract key quotes or tables; organise findings; suggest contact names.
- **Human steers:** Choose authoritative sources; verify key facts; decide what to cite.

---

## Step 4: Raise questions under the Code on Access to Information

**Actionable steps:** Draft a clear request to the relevant body (e.g. MPFA, bureau). State the decision, what information you need, and why. Cite the Code. Send by Weeks 3–4; expect ~3 weeks (up to 7) for a response.

- **AI agent can help:** Draft a first version of the request letter; suggest wording for citing the Code; check for clarity.
- **Human steers:** Finalise the request; send the letter and manage follow-up; interpret the response.

---

## Step 5: Collect community data (in parallel)

**Actionable steps:** Design small-scale data collection (e.g. survey on eMPF adoption, usability, barriers). Use fieldwork allowance (HK$300/student; submit by Week 6).

- **AI agent can help:** Draft survey questions or templates; suggest tabulation; help build CSV for analysis.
- **Human steers:** Design and conduct fieldwork; interpret data in context.

---

## Step 6: Analyse data and make recommendations

**Actionable steps:** Use math and visualization tools on your data, government responses, and curated docs. Produce clear recommendations for more data-driven decision-making. Link every chart to a question.

- **AI agent can help:** Write and run code; generate charts and statistics; draft bullet-point recommendations.
- **Human steers:** Choose which analyses matter; interpret results; write narrative and recommendations; decide what to present to Legco.

---

## Step 7: Present to Legco via the Redress System

**Actionable steps:** Complete group report (~3,000 words), poster, and two presentations. Frame as a complaint about government data governance. Submit via the Legco Redress System.

- **AI agent can help:** Draft report sections; suggest structure; help format poster or slides.
- **Human steers:** Set argument and tone; ensure accuracy; present and submit.
