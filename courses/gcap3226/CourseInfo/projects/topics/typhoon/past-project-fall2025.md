# Past project work — Typhoon Signal Decision Analysis (Fall 2025, Team 3)

Summary of GCAP 3226 Fall 2025 Team 3 work on typhoon signal timing and data governance, for reuse and adaptation in Spring 2026 and beyond.

---

## Core research question (Fall 2025)

**How can mathematical models and improved data governance enable more effective data-driven decision-making for typhoon signal timing and emergency response coordination?**

Focus areas: signal timing optimization, wind speed prediction, emergency response coordination, data governance and transparency.

## What the team did

### 1. Mathematical models for typhoon signal optimization

- **Regression analysis:** Signal timing accuracy (actual vs predicted wind); factors: announcement lead time, meteorological data quality, historical patterns.
- **Time series:** ARIMA for wind speed prediction; optimal announcement timing.
- **Simulation:** Monte Carlo for emergency response scenarios; population, evacuation routes, shelter capacity.
- **Optimization:** Minimize economic disruption while maximizing public safety; variables: announcement timing, wind thresholds, response coordination.

### 2. Data governance assessment

- **Current practices:** Meteorological data collection; signal decision documentation; emergency response measurement.
- **Gaps:** Limited data on signal timing accuracy; economic impact; public response; emergency coordination.
- **Improved framework:** Systematic data collection; real-time monitoring; stakeholder access; accountability metrics.

### 3. Report structure (outline v1)

- Introduction (context, objectives, research questions).
- Mathematical framework (regression, time series, simulation, optimization).
- Data governance assessment (current practices, gaps, improved framework).
- Model implementation and results.
- Policy recommendations and implementation.
- Conclusion and future research.
