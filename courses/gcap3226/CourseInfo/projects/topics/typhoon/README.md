# Typhoon Signal Decision Analysis — Reference Past Project (Fall 2025)

## Background

**Typhoon signal timing decisions** by the Hong Kong Observatory affect public safety, economic disruption, and emergency response. The extent to which these decisions are data-driven and how data governance could improve timing and coordination is a focus for analysis.

**Relevant bodies:** Hong Kong Observatory, Emergency Services, Legco Panel on Security.

**Note:** This topic is a **reference past project** from Fall 2025. It is not a Spring 2026 group topic but is available for inspiration and adaptation.

## Past project work (Fall 2025)

Team 3 (GCAP 3226 Fall 2025) delivered work on **mathematical models** and **data governance** for typhoon signal timing optimization. Reusable elements:

- **Mathematical models:** Regression (signal timing accuracy); time series (wind speed prediction); simulation (emergency response scenarios); optimization (signal timing decisions).
- **Data governance assessment:** Current practices (meteorological data, signal decision data); gaps (evaluation, accountability, transparency).
- **Report structure:** Introduction → mathematical framework → data governance assessment → implementation and results → recommendations.

See **[past-project-fall2025.md](past-project-fall2025.md)** for a concise summary, model descriptions, and data/tools list.

## Value for the community

- **Public safety:** Evidence-based signal timing can improve emergency response and reduce harm.
- **Data governance:** Framework for meteorological data collection, sharing, and decision transparency.
- **Accountability:** Clear metrics for evaluating signal timing decisions and Observatory processes.
