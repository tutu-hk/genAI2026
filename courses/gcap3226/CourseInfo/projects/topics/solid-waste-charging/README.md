# Solid Waste Charging — Reference Past Project (Fall 2025)

## Background

Hong Kong's **Municipal Solid Waste Charging Scheme** aims to reduce waste generation and encourage recycling. Policy implementation has faced postponement; effectiveness evaluation, behavioral impacts, and data governance remain key concerns.

**Relevant bodies:** Environmental Protection Department, Legco Panel on Environmental Affairs.

**Note:** This topic is a **reference past project** from Fall 2025. It is not a Spring 2026 group topic but is available for inspiration and adaptation.

## Past project work (Fall 2025)

Team 4 (GCAP 3226 Fall 2025) delivered work on **government decision-making**, **public perception analysis**, and **data-driven policy evaluation**. Reusable elements:

- **Government enquiries:** EPD data requests (policy design, implementation metrics, compliance data); Code on Access to Information.
- **Survey data:** GCAP3226_week2.csv with 99 validated questionnaire responses; 18 Hong Kong districts.
- **Published letters:** SCMP letters on university waste disclosure and residential recycling data.
- **Mathematical models:** Regression (policy impact, compliance factors); simulation (scenario testing, behavioral response).
- **Report structure:** Government decision-making analysis → public perception → mathematical models → policy recommendations.

See **[past-project-fall2025.md](past-project-fall2025.md)** for a concise summary, templates, and data/tools list.

## Value for the community

- **Policy transparency:** Evidence-based evaluation of government decision-making and data disclosure.
- **Environmental impact:** Better understanding of behavioral responses and scheme effectiveness.
- **Data governance:** Framework for institutional accountability (universities, residential communities) and open data.
