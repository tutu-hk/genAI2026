# Past project work — Solid Waste Charging (Fall 2025, Team 4)

Summary of GCAP 3226 Fall 2025 Team 4 work on the Municipal Solid Waste Charging Scheme, for reuse and adaptation in Spring 2026 and beyond.

---

## Core research question (Fall 2025)

**How does the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department use data-driven approaches in municipal solid waste charging policy design and implementation?**

Focus areas: government decision-making, public perception, behavioral impacts, effectiveness evaluation, data governance and transparency.

---

## What the team did

### 1. Government enquiries (Code on Access to Information)

- **EPD:** Quantitative data used in policy decisions; SOPs and evaluation criteria; compliance and effectiveness data.
- **Policy documentation:** Request for decision-making procedures and rationale for charging mechanism design.
- **Expected:** Data availability, process transparency, performance reporting.

### 2. Survey data and questionnaire analysis

- **Existing data:** GCAP3226_week2.csv — 99 validated responses; 18 Hong Kong districts; 8 key variables.
- **Variables:** Policy support (before/after info); perceived fairness; government consideration; behavioral indicators (food waste bin, recycling); housing type; geographic distribution.
- **Published letters:** SCMP letters on university waste disclosure; residential recycling data (e.g. Tai Po case study: plastics 0.29%, paper 0.9%, glass 4.55%, metal 0.99%).

### 3. Mathematical models

- **Regression:** Waste generation prediction; policy impact assessment; price elasticity; compliance factors.
- **Simulation:** Policy scenario testing (pricing, implementation); Monte Carlo; behavioral response modelling.

### 4. Report structure (outline v1/v2)

- Introduction (context, objectives, questions).
- Government decision-making framework (charging mechanism, pricing, implementation).
- Government information requests and response analysis.
- Mathematical modelling and data analysis.
- Findings and policy implications; recommendations.
- Conclusion and future research.

## Reusable elements for Spring 2026+

| Element | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **EPD enquiry template** | Adapt for Code on Access to Information; request policy data, compliance, effectiveness. |
| **Survey data** | GCAP3226_week2.csv; replication or extension; behavioral analysis. |
| **Published letters** | Precedent for data governance; university/institutional disclosure; residential recycling. |
| **Regression/simulation** | Policy impact; compliance factors; scenario testing. |
| **Report outline** | Government decision-making → public perception → models → recommendations. |

---

## Key deliverables (Fall 2025)

- Project report outlines v1–v2 (government decision-making; public perception).
- Government enquiry drafts (EPD).
- Questionnaire dataset and visualisation.
- Mathematical model framework (regression, simulation).

---

## Data and tools

- **Primary:** EPD data (Code on Access to Information); GCAP3226_week2.csv; data.gov.hk.
- **Secondary:** Government policy documents; SCMP letters; international benchmarks (Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea).
- **Models:** Regression (policy impact, compliance); simulation (scenario testing).
- **Tech:** Python/Jupyter; survey analysis; data visualisation.
