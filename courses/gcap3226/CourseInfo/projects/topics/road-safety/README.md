# Road Safety (Group 3)

## Background

**Road safety policies**, traffic management, and accident prevention are major concerns in Hong Kong. Government decisions on speed limits, black-spot treatment, pedestrian facilities, and enforcement rely on accident data, traffic counts, and risk assessments. The extent to which these decisions are data-driven and how data is shared with the public is a focus for scrutiny.

Analysing traffic accident data, government safety measures, and the evidence base behind policies can reveal gaps in data collection, publication, or use in decision-making.

**Relevant bodies:** Transport Department, Highways Department, Legco Panel on Transport, Road Safety Council.

## Value for the community

- **Safer streets:** Evidence-based recommendations (e.g. on black spots, pedestrian crossings, speed limits) can reduce injuries and fatalities.
- **Transparency:** Public access to accident and intervention data enables independent analysis and informed public debate.
- **Accountability:** Showing how (or whether) data informs decisions can push for more consistent, data-driven road safety policy.
