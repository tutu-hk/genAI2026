# Rodent Control (Group 6)

## Background

**Urban pest management** and public hygiene initiatives for rodent prevention are implemented across Hong Kong districts. Government allocates resources, sets standards, and responds to complaints; the effectiveness of policies depends on data on infestation, complaints, and interventions by area.

Key questions: What rodent or pest data is collected and published by district? How are resource and intervention decisions made? Is there room to make targeting and evaluation more data-driven?

**Relevant bodies:** Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), District Councils, Legco Panel on Environmental Affairs (or relevant panel).

## Value for the community

- **Public health and hygiene:** Better use of data can improve targeting of control measures and reduce rodent-related health and nuisance.
- **District-level transparency:** Public data by district allows residents and councils to assess local performance and advocate for fair allocation.
- **Accountability:** Showing how data (or its absence) informs pest control decisions can push for more consistent, evidence-based policies.
