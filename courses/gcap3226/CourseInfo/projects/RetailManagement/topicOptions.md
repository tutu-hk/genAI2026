# Topic Options for Hong Kong Retail Management Study

**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Project Focus:** Government's role in retail management and regulation in Hong Kong  
**Data Sources:** Government statistics, licensing data, retail regulations, market data

---

## Executive Summary

Based on research into Hong Kong government's involvement in retail management, this document outlines four viable research topics. The government's role in retail spans multiple dimensions: licensing and regulation, public market management, retail data collection/publication, and consumer protection. Each topic below includes data sources, preliminary findings, and actionable research plans aligned with GCAP 3226's focus on data-driven government decision-making.

---

## Topic 1: Public Market Management and Optimization

### Research Question
How effectively does the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) use data to manage public markets and cooked food centers, and can data-driven approaches improve their utilization and sustainability?

### Background
Hong Kong operates 99 public markets and numerous cooked food centers managed by FEHD. Many markets face low occupancy rates and declining usage, while the government makes decisions on market closures, rent adjustments, and facility upgrades. The extent to which these decisions are data-driven is unclear.

### Data Sources

#### Primary Data Sources
| Source | Type | URL | Update Frequency |
|--------|------|-----|------------------|
| **FEHD Market Statistics** | Occupancy rates, locations | https://www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/tidy_market/index.html | Annual |
| **DATA.GOV.HK** | Public market locations | https://data.gov.hk/en-datasets/provider/hk-fehd | Varies |
| **Rating and Valuation Dept** | Market rental data | https://www.rvd.gov.hk/ | Quarterly |
| **LegCo Papers** | Policy discussions | https://www.legco.gov.hk/ | Ongoing |
| **District Councils** | Local market complaints | Various district websites | Ongoing |

#### Search Strategy
- **DATA.GOV.HK:** "public market", "FEHD", "market stalls"
- **Gov.hk:** `site:fehd.gov.hk market occupancy statistics`
- **LegCo:** `site:legco.gov.hk public market management`
- **Audit Commission:** `site:aud.gov.hk public markets`

### Preliminary Findings
- FEHD publishes list of public markets with locations
- Occupancy rate data may be available through LegCo questions or annual reports
- District Councils receive complaints about market conditions
- Government has closed some markets due to low usage
- Decisions on closures or upgrades may lack transparent data justification

### Action Plan

**Phase 1: Data Collection (Week 1-2)**
1. Download complete list of FEHD-managed public markets
2. Collect occupancy rate data from LegCo papers and FEHD reports
3. Map market locations using DATA.GOV.HK datasets
4. Identify markets that have closed or been renovated (2019-2025)
5. Collect rental rate data for market stalls

**Phase 2: Government Inquiry (Week 2-3)**
Contact FEHD under Code on Access to Information for:
- Stall occupancy rates by market (monthly, 2019-2025)
- Criteria used for deciding market closures/upgrades
- Footfall data or visitor surveys (if collected)
- Financial performance data (revenue vs. operating costs)
- Complaints received about specific markets
- Methodology for setting stall rental rates

**Phase 3: Data Analysis (Week 3-5)**
1. Calculate occupancy trends over time
2. Identify geographic patterns (urban vs. rural, district-level)
3. Correlate market performance with:
   - Proximity to MTR stations
   - Nearby supermarket competition
   - Demographic factors (elderly population)
   - Public housing density
4. Compare government's closure decisions with objective data
5. Identify "data gaps" in current decision-making

**Phase 4: Policy Recommendations (Week 5-6)**
1. Propose data-driven framework for market optimization
2. Suggest metrics for measuring market "success"
3. Recommend improved data collection (e.g., footfall sensors)
4. Draft recommendations for LegCo Panel on Food Safety and Environmental Hygiene
5. Prepare final report and poster

### Potential Challenges
- Occupancy data may not be systematically collected/published
- FEHD may be reluctant to share detailed operational data
- Market closure decisions involve political considerations beyond data
- Need to distinguish between FEHD markets and private markets

### Expected Impact
- Clear evidence of data gaps in market management
- Concrete recommendations for data-driven policy
- Potential to inform future market optimization decisions

## Topic 2: Liquor Licensing and Retail Regulation

### Research Question
How does the Liquor Licensing Board use data to regulate retail alcohol sales, and are licensing decisions evidence-based regarding public health and safety concerns?

### Background
The Liquor Licensing Board regulates alcohol retail through a licensing system. Licenses are issued, renewed, and sometimes revoked based on various criteria. The board's decision-making process and use of data (crime statistics, public health data, community feedback) is a potential area for scrutiny.

   - What data is collected but not published, and why?

3. **Data-Driven Decision Making:**
   - How does the government use collected data in decisions?
   - Are decision criteria transparent and evidence-based?
   - Can we identify cases of data-deficient decisions?

4. **Data Governance Improvement:**
   - What specific improvements would enhance data governance?
   - How can data better serve public interest?
   - What best practices from other jurisdictions apply?
