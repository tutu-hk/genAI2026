## Topic 1: Immigration Flow Analysis — HK and Europe

### Research Question
How have immigration patterns between Hong Kong and European countries evolved in recent years, and what government policies influence these flows?

### Data Sources

#### Primary Data Sources
| Source | Type | URL | Update Frequency |
|--------|------|-----|------------------|
| **Immigration Department Statistics** | Government data | https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/stat_menu.html | Monthly/Annual |

- Hong Kong residents' outbound travel statistics also tracked

### Action Plan

**Phase 1: Data Collection (Week 1-2)**
1. Download visitor arrival statistics from Immigration Department (2019-2025)
2. Extract European country data from monthly reports
3. Obtain HK residents' outbound travel data to Europe
4. Collect relevant policy documents (visa policies, bilateral agreements)

**Phase 2: Data Analysis (Week 3-4)**
1. Create time series analysis of immigration flows
2. Compare pre-COVID vs. post-COVID patterns
3. Identify top 5 European countries by immigration flow
4. Analyze correlation between policy changes and flow patterns

**Phase 3: Policy Research (Week 5)**
1. Review visa policy changes affecting European visitors
2. Examine bilateral immigration agreements
3. Contact Immigration Department under Code on Access to Information for:
   - Detailed breakdown of visa application processing times
   - Policy rationale for specific immigration measures
   - Future plans for immigration facilitation

**Phase 4: Report Writing (Week 6)**
1. Document findings with data visualizations
2. Compare HK's immigration patterns with Singapore or other regional hubs
3. Recommend data-driven improvements to immigration policies

### Potential Challenges
- Data may be aggregated by region rather than individual countries
- COVID-19 disruption creates data anomalies
- Some statistics may only be in annual reports

## Recommended Topic

### Primary Recommendation: **Topic 1 - Immigration Flow Analysis**

**Rationale:**
1. **Data Availability**: Immigration Department publishes regular, detailed statistics
2. **GCAP 3226 Alignment**: Clear government decision-making process with data implications
3. **Policy Relevance**: Immigration policies directly impact HK-Europe relations
4. **Actionable Research**: Can submit formal requests under Code on Access to Information
5. **Quantifiable**: Time series data enables robust analysis

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive immigration flow dataset (2019-2025)
- Data visualization of trends and patterns
- Policy analysis report
- Recommendations for data-driven immigration facilitation

---

## Alternative Recommendation: **Combined Approach**

If the team prefers broader scope, combine **Topic 1** (Immigration Flow) with **Topic 2** (Economic Offices) under the theme:

### "People and Commerce: Data-Driven Analysis of HK-Europe Connections"

This would examine both human mobility and economic ties, using:
- Immigration statistics as proxy for people-to-people connections
- Trade data as measure of economic integration
- ETO effectiveness as policy case study

This combined approach offers:
- Richer narrative
- Multiple data sources
- Stronger policy recommendations
- Better alignment with GCAP 3226's focus on data governance
