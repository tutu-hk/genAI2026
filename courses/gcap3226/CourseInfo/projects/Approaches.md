In GCAP 3226 we are mainly concerned about to what extent the HK government staff made their decisions informed by data?

To pursue a project, we take the following steps: 

1. identify a decision made by the government; the decision could be more than one but we should focus on something that is concrete and specific 
2. review the decision and consider in what ways it is controversial or disputable; in other words, any room for improvement
3. to take these two steps, we need to search the Internet and curate publicly available information from government and Legco documents (here AI agent may help to search for Legco.gov.hk or gov.hk; the focus is on the decision-making process and the use of data; how data is managed) https://gcap3226.hkbu.tech/spring-2026/resources/curating-public-data (fetch more info here)
4. Based on the info gathered, we raise questions for the government staff to answer under the Code on Access to Information (then we wait for 3 weeks before we expect some answers; sometimes it may take longer- 7 weeks max) (fetch more info here https://gcap3226.hkbu.tech/spring-2026/resources/government-info-requests)
5. In the meantime, we may also collect some data from the community to help us better understand the problem and the data management processes; analyzing the small set of data we collect could shed some light on the issue although we do not expect any solid conclusions 
6. We then use the math tools and visualization tools we learned to analyze the data collected and info gathered from the government and make recommendations on how the decision-making processes could become more data-driven. 
7. The recommendations will be formally presented in a report to the Legislative Council, framed as a complaint against the government team, under the Legco Redress System. https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/legco-business/redress-system/handling-cases-received-under-redress-system.html (fetch more info here)
