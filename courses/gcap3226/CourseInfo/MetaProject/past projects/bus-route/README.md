# Bus Route Coordination — Past Project (Fall 2025)

**Course Portal:** [GCAP 3226 Fall 2025 — Bus Route](https://gcap3226.hkbu.tech/fall-2025/team/bus-route)

---

## Overview

This past project analyzes **bus route coordination** in Hong Kong, focusing on overlapping routes (KMB 272A and Citybus 582) and data-driven policy analysis. It corresponds to **Team 2: Bus Route Coordination** from GCAP 3226 Fall 2025. Related Spring 2026 topic: **Bus Stop Merge** (real-time API, stop placement, optimization).

---

## Core research question

**To what extent does the Hong Kong Transport Department use data-driven approaches in bus route placement, merging decisions, and urban transportation optimization?**

Focus areas: coordination between competing operators, passenger waiting times, government engagement (Transport Department, 1823), API data collection and analysis.

---

## What the team did

- **Government engagement (Code on Access to Information, 1823):** TD reply (Dec 2025): Government not willing to follow up on route coordination/merger; reasoning: routes serve different functions and passenger groups. Next step: LegCo report.
- **Real-time API data:** Hong Kong Government Open Data APIs; rush-hour bus tracking (7–9 AM, 5–7 PM); route overlap analysis; queue and arrival analysis.
- **Mathematical models:** Spatial optimization; passenger flow simulation; scenarios (baseline, conservative, aggressive, hybrid).
- **Report structure:** API data → TD process → placement principles → mathematical models → recommendations.

## Reusable elements for Spring 2026+

| Element | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **Government enquiry template** | Adapt for Transport Department; Code on Access to Information. |
| **API strategy** | data.gov.hk; real-time bus APIs; rush-hour focus; spatial analysis. |
| **Simulation framework** | Spatial optimization; passenger flow; efficiency metrics. |
| **Report outline** | API data → TD process → placement principles → recommendations. |
