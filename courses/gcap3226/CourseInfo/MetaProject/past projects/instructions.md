## Important Reminders

- **Timeline is Tentative:** Specific dates and deadlines will be confirmed during group consultations. Use this as a planning guide.
- **Government Data Requests:** Must be sent by Week 6 at the latest! Government responses can take 3+ weeks, so early submission is critical.
- **Be Specific:** Focus on concrete policy decisions rather than broad topics. "Bus stop spacing analysis" is better than "transportation policy."
- **Milestone Assessment:** Expected outputs will be assessed during group consultations. These serve as progress checkpoints, not formal submissions.
- **Document Everything:** Keep track of all data sources, requests sent, and methods used. This documentation is crucial for your final report.
