# Food Waste / Solid Waste Charging — Past Project (Fall 2025)

**Course Portal:** [GCAP 3226 Fall 2025 — Food Waste](https://gcap3226.hkbu.tech/fall-2025/team/food-waste)

---

## Overview

This past project examines Hong Kong's **Municipal Solid Waste Charging Scheme**, including food waste reduction, behavioral impacts, and data-driven policy evaluation. It corresponds to **Team 4: Solid Waste Charging** from GCAP 3226 Fall 2025.

---

## Core research question

**How does the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department use data-driven approaches in municipal solid waste charging policy design and implementation?**

Focus areas: government decision-making, public perception, behavioral impacts, effectiveness evaluation, data governance and transparency.

---

## What the team did

- **Government enquiries (Code on Access to Information):** EPD data on policy decisions, compliance, effectiveness.
- **Survey data:** GCAP3226_week2.csv — 99 validated responses; 18 Hong Kong districts; policy support, perceived fairness, behavioral indicators.
- **Published letters:** SCMP letters on university waste disclosure; residential recycling (Tai Po case study).
- **Mathematical models:** Regression (policy impact, compliance factors); simulation (scenario testing).
- **Report structure:** Government decision-making analysis → public perception → models → policy recommendations.

## Reusable elements for Spring 2026+

| Element | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **EPD enquiry template** | Adapt for Code on Access to Information; request policy data, compliance, effectiveness. |
| **Survey data** | GCAP3226_week2.csv; replication or extension; behavioral analysis. |
| **Published letters** | Precedent for data governance; university/institutional disclosure. |
| **Regression/simulation** | Policy impact; compliance factors; scenario testing. |
