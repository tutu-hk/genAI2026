# Team 3: Typhoon Signal Decision Analysis — Past Project (Fall 2025)

---

## Overview

This past project develops **mathematical models** and **data governance** frameworks for typhoon signal timing optimization and emergency response coordination. It corresponds to **Team 3: Typhoon Signal Analysis** from GCAP 3226 Fall 2025. Reference Spring 2026 topic: **typhoon** (reference past project only, not a group topic).

---

## Core research question

**How can mathematical models and improved data governance enable more effective data-driven decision-making for typhoon signal timing and emergency response coordination?**

Focus areas: signal timing optimization, wind speed prediction, emergency response scenarios, data governance and transparency.

---

## What the team did

- **Mathematical models:** Regression (signal timing accuracy); time series (ARIMA for wind speed); simulation (Monte Carlo for emergency response); optimization (safety vs economic disruption).
- **Data governance assessment:** Current practices (meteorological data, signal decisions); gaps (evaluation, accountability, transparency); improved framework.
- **Report structure (outline v1):** Introduction → mathematical framework → data governance assessment → implementation and results → recommendations.

## Reusable elements for Spring 2026+

| Element | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **Regression model** | Signal timing accuracy vs announcement lead time, data quality. |
| **Time series (ARIMA)** | Wind speed prediction; optimal timing. |
| **Simulation** | Emergency response scenarios; Monte Carlo. |
| **Optimization** | Objective: safety vs economic disruption; constraints. |
| **Data governance checklist** | Meteorological data; signal decision documentation. |
