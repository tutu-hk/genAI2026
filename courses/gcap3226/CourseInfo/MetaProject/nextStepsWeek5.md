# Next Steps — Week 5

**GCAP 3226 Spring 2026 | Empowering Citizens through Data**

Your group has been assigned a topic. This guide walks you through the concrete steps to take **this week and next** to turn your topic into a focused project with research questions, hypotheses, and government enquiry letters.

---

## Overview

By the end of Week 5, each group should have:

1. A **specific government decision** (not a broad topic) as the focus of your project.
2. A **research question** and **hypotheses** about data-driven decision-making.
3. A **curated collection of public information** (Legco, government websites, open data).
4. A **draft government enquiry letter** ready to send by Week 6.

## Step 1: Choose a specific government decision

Your topic (flu shot, colorectal cancer screening, road safety, eMPF, CDCC, rodent control, bus stop merge) is a **starting point**, not a finished research focus.

**What to do:**

- Within your topic, identify **one or two concrete decisions** that government staff have made (or should have made) based on data. Examples:
  - *Flu shot:* Decision to target school-age children with in-school vaccination; allocation of vaccination sites by district.
  - *Bus stop merge:* Decision not to coordinate KMB 272A and Citybus 582 timetables despite 8 overlapping stops.
  - *Rodent control:* Decision to allocate rodent control resources by district complaint count vs. by infestation survey data.

- **Tip:** A good decision focus is **specific** ("bus stop spacing on Route X in Sha Tin") rather than broad ("public transport policy in Hong Kong").

**Past project example:**
- Team 2 (Bus Route Coordination, Fall 2025) focused on whether the Transport Department uses data to decide on route coordination — and received a concrete reply from TD via 1823. See [bus-stop-merge past project](../projects/topics/bus-stop-merge/past-project-fall2025.md).
- Team 1 (Flu Shot, Fall 2025) focused on school vaccination participation rates and data collection methods. See [flu-shot past project](../projects/topics/flu-shot/past-project-fall2025.md).

## Step 2: Search for public information on data governance

Before writing to the government, find out **what information is already public**.

**What to search for:**

1. **Government websites** (gov.hk, department sites):
   - Policy documents, press releases, annual reports.
   - Published data or statistics (e.g. vaccination coverage, accident counts, screening rates).
2. **Legislative Council (legco.gov.hk):**
   - Panel meeting minutes (e.g. Panel on Health Services, Panel on Transport).
   - Questions raised by lawmakers and government replies.
   - Official papers (e.g. funding proposals, policy reviews).
3. **Open data portal (data.gov.hk):**
   - Search for datasets related to your topic. Note what exists and what is missing.
4. **Media coverage:**
   - News articles that reveal government decisions or public debate about your topic.

**How to do this with AI:**

- Use an AI agent (e.g. Cursor, ChatGPT, Perplexity) to **search systematically**. Ask it to find Legco panel minutes, government press releases, and open data for your topic.
- Organise findings in a shared folder (GitHub repo or Google Doc) so the group can reference the same sources.

**Key questions to answer:**

- What data does the government **already publish** about this decision?
- What data is **missing** or **hard to find**?
- Is there evidence that the decision was (or was not) informed by data?
- What have Legco members or the public already asked about this?

**Past project example:**
- Team 4 (Solid Waste Charging, Fall 2025) found published SCMP letters on waste data disclosure and identified EPD's limited data sharing. See [solid-waste-charging past project](../projects/topics/solid-waste-charging/past-project-fall2025.md).

## Step 3: Formulate your research question and hypotheses

The core course question is:

> **To what extent did HK government staff make their decisions informed by data?**

Your research question **applies this to your specific decision**.

**Template:**

> To what extent does [department] use data-driven approaches in [specific decision], and what improvements in data collection, analysis, or transparency could lead to better outcomes?

**Examples:**

| Group | Research question |
|-------|-------------------|
| Flu Shot | To what extent does the Department of Health use school-level vaccination data to allocate flu vaccination resources by district? |
| Road Safety | How does the Transport Department use traffic accident data to prioritise black-spot treatment and pedestrian facility improvements? |
| eMPF | How transparent is the eMPF platform's reporting of fund performance data, and does it enable informed retirement planning? |
| Bus Stop Merge | To what extent does the Transport Department use real-time ridership data to evaluate bus stop placement and merging decisions? |

**Hypotheses:**

For each research question, propose **2–3 testable hypotheses** about data-driven decision-making. Example:

1. *The government collects relevant data but does not publish it systematically.*
2. *Decisions are made based on precedent or budget rather than data analysis.*
3. *Better data transparency would enable more effective policy outcomes (e.g. higher uptake, fewer accidents).*

Your analysis (Steps 5–6 in the [enhanced approaches](../projects/enhancedApproaches.md)) will test these hypotheses against evidence.

## Step 4: Draft your government enquiry letter

**Goal:** Send a clear, specific request to the relevant department under the **Code on Access to Information** by **Week 6**.

**What to include:**

1. **State the decision or policy** you are asking about.
2. **List specific data points** you need (e.g. "School-level flu vaccination participation rates for 2022–2025").
3. **Explain why** the data matters for understanding data-driven decision-making.
4. **Cite the Code on Access to Information** as the basis for your request.

**Practical tips:**

- Keep requests **concise and specific** (≤2 focused questions per group).
- Use the **government telephone directory** to identify the right department and contact (not just 1823).
- **Send early** — responses take ~3 weeks (up to 7 weeks). The sooner you send, the more useful the response is for your report.

**Past project templates:**

| Group area | Template source |
|------------|-----------------|
| Flu Shot | DoH email drafts in [flu-shot past project](../projects/topics/flu-shot/past-project-fall2025.md) |
| Bus routes | TD request in [bus-stop-merge past project](../projects/topics/bus-stop-merge/past-project-fall2025.md) |
| Solid waste | EPD enquiry in [solid-waste-charging past project](../projects/topics/solid-waste-charging/past-project-fall2025.md) |
| General | [Government information requests guide](https://gcap3226.hkbu.tech/spring-2026/resources/government-info-requests) |

## Step 5: Plan your next moves (Weeks 6–7)

While waiting for the government response, you should **work in parallel**:

| Task | Timeline | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Collect community data** | Weeks 6–7 | Survey, observations, interviews. Use fieldwork allowance (HK$300/student; submit by Week 6). |
| **Explore open data** | Weeks 5–6 | Search data.gov.hk; download and visualise relevant datasets in Jupyter. |
| **Write Reflective Essay 1** | Due Week 5 | Reflect on regression & simulation models and their connection to your project. |
| **Curate Legco/government docs** | Ongoing | Organise in a shared place (GitHub, Google Doc) for group reference. |
