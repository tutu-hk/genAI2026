review courses/gcap3226/CourseInfo/MetaProject/past projects
describe how to select a focus of the project including specific government decisions and how to review data governance practices of the HK government through web search first 

then based on the info gathered, how to raise questions for the government to answer 

the key is to have a research question and some hypotheses about data driven decision making 

the short-term goal is to select a topic, find info on the topic, formulate research questions and hypotheses and raise questions for the government staff to answer 

create a nextStepsWeek5.md to describe the next steps that students should take drawing upon insights from courses/gcap3226/CourseInfo/MetaProject/past projects as well as files with links found in courses/gcap3226/CourseInfo/projects and `3226Spring2026/week5plan.md`
