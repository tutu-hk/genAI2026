# GCAP3226 Week 2 — Summary

## Key points

### Session focus
- **Week 2** is hands-on: GitHub, vibe coding, and **data visualization** with Python.
- Input: spreadsheets/CSV data that are hard to interpret as raw numbers. Output: clear visualizations so people can understand and gain insights.
- Goal: Show how AI can help write code (especially Python) so students without strong programming or STEM background can still use the technology. Small class size allows more support.

### Technical setup (Talia & Simon)
- **Bring a laptop** (tablets may require a different workflow, e.g. log in to GitHub in browser first).
- **VS Code** — install and use as main environment.
- **GitHub** — sign up and log in; **two-factor authentication** required. In VS Code, the AI agent can prompt you to continue to GitHub to log in and authorize.
- **Jupyter Notebook** — used inside VS Code for writing and running code.
- **Python** — required to run notebooks; can be installed via the agent (e.g. “Do we have Python installed?” / “Install Python”); agent can run commands in the terminal. Auto-approve can be enabled for agent actions.

### Materials (Moodle)
- **Week 2** on Moodle: download the **CSV file** and the **Jupyter Notebook** (student version; full/teacher version shared later).
- Save both in the same folder and open the folder in VS Code.

### Data and task
- **CSV** = comma-separated values; first line is metadata, then 97 lines of raw data (survey questionnaire results). Hard to gain insights from raw rows of numbers.
- **Task:** Write code so the machine reads the CSV and produces **visualizations**; humans then interpret the pictures. This is what **data visualization** is about.
- Alternatives (e.g. opening CSV in Excel or a “rainbow” CSV extension) help view structure but do not replace visualization for insight.

### Vibe coding and AI agent
- **Ask mode** — more limited but good for learning; recommended to start here so you understand what’s happening.
- **Agent mode** — more powerful, does more for you; try once you are comfortable, so you don’t skip learning.
- AI can help write Python, fix syntax errors, and run terminal commands (e.g. install Python). You set the goal; the agent figures out steps (e.g. check if Python is installed, then install if not).

### Workflow
- Create or open a folder in VS Code → get CSV and notebook from Moodle into that folder → open notebook → ensure Python is available (agent can help) → use AI to write/run code that reads the CSV and generates visualizations.

## Actionable insights

1. **Before or at start of Week 2:** Install VS Code, create GitHub account with 2FA, install Python (or let the agent do it), and have the Week 2 CSV and Jupyter Notebook from Moodle in one folder.
2. **Start with Ask mode** when using the in-editor AI so you learn; move to Agent mode when you want more automation.
3. **Use one folder** for the CSV and the notebook so paths in code stay simple.
4. **If stuck:** Use the agent to check environment (e.g. “Do we have Python installed?”) and to generate or fix code; ask for small, concrete steps.
5. **Data viz goal:** Always link the code to a clear question (e.g. “What does this survey show?”) so the visualization has a purpose.
