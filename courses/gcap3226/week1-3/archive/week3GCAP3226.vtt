1
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.120
Simon Wang: YYY testing.

2
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:26.590
Simon Wang: All right, so, welcome to this course. We're in week 2 now, still at your period. So, last week we already did the introduction. We are going to share the video recording very soon, I haven't got a chance to

3
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.850
Simon Wang: Uploaded to the… Website.

4
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.700
Simon Wang: And also on Moodle, so we're kind of still, catch up.

5
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.390
Simon Wang: So, this week… It would be, quite a bit of hands-on activities.

6
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.710
Simon Wang: Which would involve, using GitHub, Vibe coding, but, I hope…

7
00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:02.880
Simon Wang: it won't scare you or intimidate you, even though maybe you're not from, you know, technical programming or STEM background.

8
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:17.680
Simon Wang: Because the whole point of, teach you vibe coding is so that you can leverage AI to, write the codes without necessarily worrying too much about all the syntax and everything.

9
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:31.339
Simon Wang: So… and the good news is that this semester we have a very relatively small class size, so I'm sure that everybody will get a sufficient amount of attention and support.

10
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.729
Simon Wang: To be able to learn, all the technical stuff.

11
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.430
Simon Wang: So,

12
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:51.880
Simon Wang: Maybe I just very quickly go through, week one, kind of what… where you can find the materials, and also in the… in the video. We have a QR code here, and also we have a WhatsApp group, yeah.

13
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.790
Simon Wang: So it's not…

14
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.180
Simon Wang: I think what we need to do is to…

15
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.930
Simon Wang: So we have, QR code you can scan, but then I also already shared a link

16
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.650
Simon Wang: to our WhatsApp group.

17
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.790
Simon Wang: So, you should be able to have access to this page.

18
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.210
Simon Wang: So, in, in, the course homepage, you can see that we got information about the course objectives.

19
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.599
Simon Wang: And all the information we already went through, last week.

20
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:47.099
Simon Wang: And we also have a course roadmap that kind of mapped out the journey of this course, starting from week 1 all the way to week 13.

21
00:02:47.740 --> 00:03:04.790
Simon Wang: And in week one, we have already talked a little bit about data governance. That's, that's from me and my colleague, Talia, Dr. Wu. She's from maths department, and she talks a little bit about technology and math. So, you know, just basic stuff.

22
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.319
Simon Wang: Now, in week 2, today, we're going to, focus on

23
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:26.929
Simon Wang: you know, how we can do vibe coding and write some code to visualize the data. So, the input would be some spreadsheet, some data that's a little bit difficult to understand, it's all just rows of

24
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:43.079
Simon Wang: Numbers and everything. But, we're going to write some codes to learn how to visualize it and turn the relatively boring data sets into something more visually appealing, something that everybody can understand.

25
00:03:43.430 --> 00:04:00.959
Simon Wang: And more importantly, we want to demonstrate how AI can actually help us to write code, to write Python, to be more specific, so that we can leverage the technology, even though we haven't done much training, in this, in this area.

26
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:12.459
Simon Wang: So hopefully you will be able to appreciate the power and the potential of AI and the technology, especially for students who are not from the programming or STEM background.

27
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:30.210
Simon Wang: Okay, so just to be mentally prepared for a little bit of challenges and, you know, technical stuff, and also for the students who are watching the video, you know, we will support you to make sure that you will be able to learn all the techniques you need.

28
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:39.959
Simon Wang: So, without further ado, I'd like to invite Talia to, start talking about the technical, aspects.

29
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.140
Simon Wang: Okay, thank you, Simon. May I know whether you bring your laptop With you?

30
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.060
Simon Wang: Yeah, I can't see your laptop.

31
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.420
Simon Wang: How about others?

32
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.839
Simon Wang: No? Yes? Okay, great.

33
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.200
Simon Wang: So, half-half, I think.

34
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.110
Simon Wang: Okay.

35
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.699
Simon Wang: So, as mentioned by Simon, we will focus on the data visualization task today.

36
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.739
Simon Wang: And later, I will introduce the context of the dataset we will be analyzing.

37
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.029
Simon Wang: But before that, I would like to do some technical setup.

38
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:29.210
Simon Wang: I think first, it is about the, the interface that we will use to, type code, or type the prompt.

39
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.329
Simon Wang: So it is called the VS Code.

40
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.229
Simon Wang: I think here is, if you can go to our course website.

41
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.219
Simon Wang: Under the setup steps, the first step will be install the Visual Studio Code.

42
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:52.429
Simon Wang: So if you have not installed this software into your laptop, you can just go to this website.

43
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.380
Simon Wang: And just click the download button.

44
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.440
Simon Wang: And run the installer.

45
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.639
Simon Wang: And follow the instructions, and then you can launch the VS Code.

46
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.770
Simon Wang: And to confirm that it works.

47
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.640
Simon Wang: So this will be a, like, installation for this VS Code.

48
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:19.000
Simon Wang: So later, we will, as mentioned, type the code or write our prompt, within this interface.

49
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.399
Simon Wang: So this is about the software installation.

50
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.010
Simon Wang: Shall we go to the,

51
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:50.260
Simon Wang: So, for the newcomers, we have a QR code. You can scan this QR code to, get our course website.

52
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.930
Simon Wang: Okay, so now we are at week 2.

53
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.550
Simon Wang: Okay.

54
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:16.630
Simon Wang: So after the installation of the VS Code, you also need to sign up for a GitHub account.

55
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:25.500
Simon Wang: Because later, we will make use of GitHub Copilot, as your assistant when you do the programming task.

56
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.709
Simon Wang: And on the slides, there are some, useful links.

57
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.919
Simon Wang: For example, this… here is a quick start for GitHub Copilot. It's about the GitHub docs.

58
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.409
Simon Wang: So, say, if I click it.

59
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.650
Simon Wang: You will see some, instructions.

60
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.570
Simon Wang: So specifically, sign up for GitHub Copilot.

61
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.610
Simon Wang: To use the co-pilot, you first need a personal GitHub account.

62
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.330
Simon Wang: Then, with access to a co-pilot plan.

63
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.060
Simon Wang: So if,

64
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.810
Simon Wang: all of you are full-time students here, so you can use your Hong Kong BU email address to sign up

65
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.129
Simon Wang: this, GitHub account.

66
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.980
Simon Wang: So that later you can, apply for the educational benefit.

67
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:28.280
Simon Wang: Which, basically, there's no limitation when you chat with the GitHub Copilot, and also use the agent mode.

68
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:36.809
Simon Wang: So you may, like, spend a few minutes to, sign up for, GitHub.

69
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.540
Simon Wang: And for the second hyperlink on this page.

70
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:53.250
Simon Wang: there is an introduction about the GitHub education documentation.

71
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.220
Simon Wang: So you can click this Apply to GitHub Education as a student.

72
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:09.519
Simon Wang: Then, once you have the GitHub account, you can go to the setting.

73
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.370
Simon Wang: page.

74
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.009
Simon Wang: That will be… That will look like this.

75
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.110
Simon Wang: So, on the right-hand side, this is my account, and if I click Setting.

76
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.080
Simon Wang: I will be able to see the, the sidebar.

77
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.289
Simon Wang: And at the left-hand side, there is the billing and licensing.

78
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.509
Simon Wang: And under this section, there will be an educational benefit.

79
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.190
Simon Wang: So this needs the, needs application to be, to be activated.

80
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:52.229
Simon Wang: And I think previously I… when I first applied

81
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.930
Simon Wang: applied for this education benefits, I actually met some problem.

82
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:05.779
Simon Wang: Because I did not set up the, like, two-step author… authentic… authentication.

83
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:11.030
Simon Wang: So, it's like, key tub.

84
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.050
Simon Wang: 2… vector.

85
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.550
Simon Wang: authentication. Two-factor authentication.

86
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.590
Simon Wang: Oops.

87
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.670
Simon Wang: So basically, you need to download an app.

88
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.279
Simon Wang: Which allows for this multi-factor authentication.

89
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:56.100
Simon Wang: and then add your GitHub account into this into this app.

90
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:04.950
Simon Wang: So that every time when you sign in the, your GitHub account, it will ask you, like, a 6-digit code.

91
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.829
Simon Wang: Like what is shown here.

92
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:16.320
Simon Wang: And this app will generate a 6-digit code, and it will be refreshed, like, every 60 seconds.

93
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.850
Simon Wang: So… so after that, 60 seconds, a new code will be generated.

94
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:30.580
Simon Wang: when you… sign in via GitHub account, you need to input this 6-digit code.

95
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:38.699
Simon Wang: And I think only after you, install this app and

96
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:50.560
Simon Wang: enroll your GitHub account into this app, then you can, like, apply for the educational benefit. Otherwise, it will, reject your application.

97
00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:06.400
Simon Wang: So this is, the basics of the GitHub Copilot, Yep.

98
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:11.210
Simon Wang: And the other, important element is Python, so…

99
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.130
Simon Wang: Basically all of the code that

100
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:21.469
Simon Wang: We will use to implement our… either the data visualization or later some,

101
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:27.569
Simon Wang: like, regression models, or the simulation, all of them will be implemented using Python.

102
00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.669
Simon Wang: So you need to also, download and install Python.

103
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.799
Simon Wang: In your laptop.

104
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.910
Simon Wang: I think maybe I leave, like, 10 minutes for you to…

105
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:52.829
Simon Wang: like, sign up for GitHub Copilot, and also download the VS Code and Python, so that we will be on the same page.

106
00:12:53.410 --> 00:13:11.400
Simon Wang: And if you need any help, just feel free to raise your hand. Today, Simon and I, and also we have a student partner who took this course last semester, Waiman. She will also be help, be helping if you have any questions.

107
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.680
Simon Wang: Right.

108
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.150
Simon Wang: So I think it would be easier if you are using your notebook computer.

109
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:26.940
Simon Wang: But, if you got a tablet, I think that… should work.

110
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:35.100
Simon Wang: To a limited extent, Right? Because, I think they can go to the… virtual Codespace.

111
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.019
Simon Wang: But I think we still recommend you to bring a mobile computer whenever possible.

112
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:50.119
Simon Wang: If you got a mobile phone, that would be very, very hard. But, you can maybe share the computer with your friend.

113
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.610
Simon Wang: First.

114
00:13:52.180 --> 00:14:09.600
Simon Wang: Okay, so when we do this kind of technical things, I hope we can, also remember the big picture, okay? So there's two levels of understanding. One is the conceptual level, the other is technical level. Of course, we want to make sure that the technical part will work.

115
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:27.160
Simon Wang: But then, even if you run into the technical issues or problems, don't get too frustrated, because at least you should be able to understand something at a conceptual level first, right? You need to know how this technology… what can it accomplish?

116
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:37.109
Simon Wang: Right? Because if you understand what this technology can help you with, and then you can decide, you know, how much effort you want to put into it to make it work.

117
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:49.680
Simon Wang: You will probably get a little bit more motivation to make it work if you first understand what this technology can accomplish. So, to answer the question, what the technology can accomplish, the short answer would be

118
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.390
Simon Wang: It can enable us to write codes.

119
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.099
Simon Wang: That, previously would require at least 50 hours of training.

120
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.650
Simon Wang: Right? But now, you only need…

121
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.589
Simon Wang: At one-hour training, you can start, writing codes.

122
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:17.009
Simon Wang: So, so, so that's… that's what this is about. That's… this is what Vibe coding is about. So… so hopefully you appreciate the potential, and then you can try to get… get into details and try to figure out how things work.

123
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:35.139
Simon Wang: All right? So, yeah, so whenever you feel there's a technical challenge, we are here to help, and also remember, once you figure this out, you will become a, someone who can write codes without learning how to write the codes, okay? So, which I believe is really, really amazing.

124
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:44.030
Simon Wang: So, while you're… you're working, let me also download the… WS Code.

125
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.809
Simon Wang: But, heh.

126
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:58.079
Simon Wang: the funny thing about, me downloading is that, once I restart a computer, everything will be gone. So it's, you know, kind of a temporary, thing.

127
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:22.319
Simon Wang: But I think, the good thing is we are actually going…

128
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:28.359
Simon Wang: we have this recorded, so I think that will be… Helpful.

129
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.940
Simon Wang: Okay, so as you can see here…

130
00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.030
Simon Wang: This is the VS Code.

131
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:15.089
Simon Wang: Now, if you are using your tablet computer, then you have to first log in to GitHub.

132
00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.610
Simon Wang: You can go to GitHub first and log in.

133
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.170
Simon Wang: It will be a slightly different, approach.

134
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:29.790
Simon Wang: Now, once you are here, you need to log in… to your… Keyhop?

135
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:37.430
Simon Wang: So… It's, the profile here, let me see…

136
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.379
Simon Wang: You can try talk to the agent.

137
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.590
Simon Wang: You know, when you, when you type hi.

138
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:56.670
Simon Wang: on the right-hand side, immediately you will, it will ask you to continue to GitHub.

139
00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:05.730
Simon Wang: So… This is when you can actually log in.

140
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.830
Simon Wang: Okay?

141
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.280
Simon Wang: So… In case you,

142
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:22.039
Simon Wang: So, you see, when you, when you say hi to the agent, the agent will ask you to log in.

143
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.640
Simon Wang: And then you just go ahead and log in.

144
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:32.590
Simon Wang: As, as Talia mentioned, you need to do this, two-way authentication.

145
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.400
Simon Wang: So… and I have the… the… app.

146
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:47.040
Simon Wang: So I just need to type in the two figures on my app to approve my login from another computer.

147
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:55.479
Simon Wang: And I need to authorize VS Code, you know, to access my GitHub.

148
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.310
Simon Wang: So now, as you can see,

149
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.749
Simon Wang: the AI agent is about to, start working.

150
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:22.260
Simon Wang: Now, this… As you can see here, the AI has got several modes. There's Agent, Ask, Edit, and Plan.

151
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.609
Simon Wang: Hmo is a bit more advanced.

152
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.460
Simon Wang: We are going to start with Ask.

153
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:29.570
Simon Wang: Right?

154
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.530
Simon Wang: So, ask mode would be,

155
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:47.990
Simon Wang: the function is more limited, but it's useful for you to learn things, right? Because the agent mode is, like, everything… it will do it for you, but then you won't have the opportunity to actually learn anything. So, I would recommend start with ask mode.

156
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.130
Simon Wang: later on.

157
00:20:50.550 --> 00:21:00.709
Simon Wang: when, when you become more comfortable with this technology, I would encourage you to, explore agent mode, which would be actually, more powerful.

158
00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.710
Simon Wang: Okay?

159
00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:06.660
Simon Wang: Now, I want to make sure that everybody is on this page.

160
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:16.500
Simon Wang: Which means you have your VS Code, downloaded, installed, and also log in with your GitHub account.

161
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.709
Simon Wang: Alright, so this will take a little while, but I hope you can be patient.

162
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:30.630
Simon Wang: and try to figure things out, and we're here to help. And then the next step is to download some codes and start doing the coding.

163
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.650
Simon Wang: Now, if you are ahead of the game, you can go to Moodle.

164
00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:09.239
Simon Wang: And, check out the week 2, there's a link there. You can download the CSV file.

165
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.800
Simon Wang: If you already, got… the VS Code.

166
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.580
Simon Wang: Ready.

167
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:29.579
Simon Wang: Raise your hand if you already got your VS Code and GitHub.

168
00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:30.710
Simon Wang: Okay?

169
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.060
Simon Wang: GitHub loin?

170
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.420
Simon Wang: Okay, great.

171
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.610
Simon Wang: So, are we… are we good?

172
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:57.060
Simon Wang: Now… once we… have your VS Code installed.

173
00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.450
Simon Wang: You can look at this setup a little bit.

174
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:07.770
Simon Wang: You can see that on the left-hand side, we've got

175
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.159
Simon Wang: A space to navigate files, right?

176
00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:16.130
Simon Wang: You can open a… folder.

177
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.950
Simon Wang: Or you can start, creating a new folder.

178
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:26.829
Simon Wang: So, like, right now, I just create a new folder for demo.

179
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:37.900
Simon Wang: Okay, so right now, this folder is, empty.

180
00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.640
Simon Wang: And we need to, get some files.

181
00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:55.289
Simon Wang: So what do we do? Well, we go to Moodle, Because we have already, prepared some files there.

182
00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:00.679
Simon Wang: So, we go to Moodle, and go to week 2,

183
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:07.550
Simon Wang: And you can see here, we've got a spreadsheet, and also the Jupyter Notebook.

184
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.650
Simon Wang: So now your job is to download the file.

185
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:18.420
Simon Wang: 2… Where you, you know, where you put your folder.

186
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:24.079
Simon Wang: Like, in my case, I… got a folder here, so I saved the file.

187
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:34.879
Simon Wang: And, I need to save… This file as well.

188
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:40.510
Simon Wang: So now we've got two files, all on the same folder, right here.

189
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.390
Simon Wang: Okay?

190
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:49.760
Simon Wang: So now you see… The CSV file is kind of a simplified version of spreadsheet.

191
00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.960
Simon Wang: There's a total of 98…

192
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:55.930
Simon Wang: lines. The first line is the metadata.

193
00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.790
Simon Wang: So there's, 97 lines of raw data.

194
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:06.670
Simon Wang: And you can see this is actually, the results of some survey questionnaire.

195
00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:12.390
Simon Wang: And which… If you just look at this, you can't really gain any insights from it.

196
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.830
Simon Wang: Right? Because there's just too many… Numbers.

197
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:21.670
Simon Wang: And our job is to write some codes To read this.

198
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:34.780
Simon Wang: File, but the machine is going to run the code on this file, so that we're going to generate some nice pictures, and human will be able to see those pictures and gain insights about the data.

199
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.189
Simon Wang: That's what data visualization is about.

200
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:43.980
Simon Wang: I mean, you could potentially go to

201
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:57.419
Simon Wang: GitHub, I'm sorry, go to, like, Poe, or go to HKBU AI, and say, look, we have this CSV, can you teach me how to write Python, right? But then you have to do a lot of copy and paste.

202
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.300
Simon Wang: In order to get some codes that work.

203
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:02.400
Simon Wang: Okay?

204
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:10.449
Simon Wang: And, as you can see here, this is very raw, because this is CSV.

205
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.549
Simon Wang: Do you know what's CSV?

206
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.600
Simon Wang: CSV stands for comma… separated… what's the V?

207
00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:21.139
Simon Wang: Value, okay.

208
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:22.909
Simon Wang: Good, thanks.

209
00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:27.450
Simon Wang: But if you, install this rainbow thing.

210
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:35.639
Simon Wang: you will be able to view the CSV, in a kind of more visually appealing way, but it's still kind of, like,

211
00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:38.809
Simon Wang: It's still no spreadsheet, right?

212
00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:44.730
Simon Wang: But if you want to open up in Excel, you can also do that.

213
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.030
Simon Wang: Okay, so you can actually open it on Excel.

214
00:34:52.370 --> 00:35:04.490
Simon Wang: So if it's on Excel, you can see a table, okay? But it doesn't really matter. No matter which format you are reading this file, it's still not very, kind of intuitive.

215
00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:05.420
Simon Wang: Right?

216
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:15.280
Simon Wang: Now, let's very quickly go through the Jupyter Notebook. It's the student version. We're going to share the teacher, the full version a bit later.

217
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.910
Simon Wang: Now, as you can see here,

218
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:25.370
Simon Wang: My computer is… it's smart. It's already asked me to, kind of, install some kind of Python.

219
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.229
Simon Wang: I think we can just go ahead and do that.

220
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.500
Simon Wang: Oh, okay.

221
00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:45.940
Simon Wang: Right, so we do need to download Python,

222
00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:52.989
Simon Wang: But I think what we could do is, just ask agent, do we have Python installed?

223
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:08.009
Simon Wang: And, and, it would, would ask you, so, so, and then, well, I actually would kind of get ahead of ourselves.

224
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:12.989
Simon Wang: But… but Agent would… check the Python for us.

225
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.740
Simon Wang: And also run this command line here.

226
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.350
Simon Wang: So, we, we just ask,

227
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:49.020
Simon Wang: I mean, there are different ways to do this, right? We can go to a website to download it and do it manually, but here we're trying to do it

228
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.870
Simon Wang: You know, AI is helping us to do it.

229
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:00.990
Simon Wang: And, you can also enable auto-approve.

230
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.590
Simon Wang: And as you can see, this is the command line interface.

231
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:15.890
Simon Wang: The agent writes some command lines to run on the terminal.

232
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.920
Simon Wang: And then it will start downloading and installing Python for us.

233
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.740
Simon Wang: Now, Python is being installed.

234
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:38.739
Simon Wang: So you can see this is the power of AI, because AI is kind of take over

235
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:47.019
Simon Wang: and do all the stuff for us. As long as we set up the goal, we tell agent, you know, we want to install Python.

236
00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:55.579
Simon Wang: And, the agent will try to figure it out, start by checking whether why the Python is available.

237
00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:01.719
Simon Wang: Whether it's installed, and when it is not installed, then they will try to set up something.

238
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:09.089
Simon Wang: And blah blah blah, and then check again, And as you can see.

239
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.730
Simon Wang: So now, Python is installed.

240
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.059
Simon Wang: We're going to test it directly.

241
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:37.049
Simon Wang: But, you know, it works here for me, it may not work on your computer.

242
00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.090
Simon Wang: So, if, you, you got, you know.

243
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.770
Simon Wang: If it doesn't work, there are different ways to make it happen.

244
00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:59.999
Simon Wang: Now, if you look at all these codes and command and everything, you feel a bit overwhelmed.

245
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:08.390
Simon Wang: I understand, that's okay. But, the good news is, is that you don't really have to worry too much about all these details.

246
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:14.790
Simon Wang: all these technical issues, because, you know, AI is going to take care of this for us.

247
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.100
Simon Wang: Right?

248
00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:28.229
Simon Wang: See, now, you see Python, this particular version has been installed and working.

249
00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:35.230
Simon Wang: Right? And we don't really do anything. All we do is click, click, click, and let the AI to do the work for us.

250
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:42.429
Simon Wang: Now, once, AI, once Python is installed, you have to go back here.

251
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.900
Simon Wang: Which is the file and folder navigation ping.

252
00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:53.190
Simon Wang: So you see, we go back here, and this is the file, and this is Jupyter…

253
00:39:54.100 --> 00:40:00.150
Simon Wang: And, you, you have to click this in order to, get the…

254
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:06.930
Simon Wang: Right, in order to… to get back to the chat, Okay?

255
00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:12.339
Simon Wang: Now, if you want to start a new session, you can do that.

256
00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:17.659
Simon Wang: So this is a new session? Okay, because the context window of AI is limited.

257
00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:24.110
Simon Wang: It will start forgetting things, so maybe you want to start a new session to do a new task.

258
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:25.330
Simon Wang: Okay?

259
00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:27.910
Simon Wang: Are we good?

260
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.319
Simon Wang: So let me just quickly look at…

261
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.700
Simon Wang: this Jupyter notebook. It actually provides a little bit of background.

262
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:46.879
Simon Wang: our goal is to visualize the data for MSW charging scheme.

263
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:52.740
Simon Wang: In Hong Kong. So, this dataset is actually the result of some questionnaire.

264
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.570
Simon Wang: On the charging scheme.

265
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.460
Simon Wang: MSW stands for Municipal Solid Waste.

266
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:00.630
Simon Wang: Okay.

267
00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.540
Simon Wang: So… Yeah.

268
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.840
Simon Wang: Okay.

269
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.249
Simon Wang: Right, so I hope everybody can reach this… this stage.

270
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:28.289
Simon Wang: Whether you use the agent method, or you just download and install it manually yourself, it doesn't really matter.

271
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:34.560
Simon Wang: Before we start looking at how to manipulate or process the data.

272
00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:35.860
Simon Wang: Okay.

273
00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:34.990
Simon Wang: downloadable.

274
00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:00.700
Simon Wang: set up.

275
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:55.350
Simon Wang: Alright, so, I… we didn't prepare for students who, are going to

276
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:59.340
Simon Wang: Use tablet computer, but if you do.

277
00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:04.380
Simon Wang: I mean, you can even try it on your mobile phone. Please go to week 2,

278
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:11.170
Simon Wang: And, we have a new file, we have a new, page, which is for GitHub Online.

279
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:22.870
Simon Wang: And, what, you can do is just, send this line to AI Agent,

280
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:32.640
Simon Wang: Because what… what we did is to set up a… public… repository here.

281
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:39.260
Simon Wang: was… the two files.

282
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.830
Simon Wang: Okay?

283
00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:48.089
Simon Wang: So what you can… what you can do is go to your…

284
00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.319
Simon Wang: Well, actually, let me, let me think.

285
00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:03.849
Simon Wang: there are a couple things you can do. One… one is, actually, you can fork We can fork this.

286
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:05.770
Simon Wang: Okay.

287
00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:11.280
Simon Wang: So you can fork this, I think that that might be,

288
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.860
Simon Wang: a good way. Or if you're already on your code space.

289
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:20.040
Simon Wang: Then you can just ask agent to clone this to my local folder.

290
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:22.980
Simon Wang: Alright, so either way, either way should work.

291
00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:33.549
Simon Wang: So other than… and anyone else is using a tablet computer? Raise your hand if you are using a tablet computer.

292
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.759
Simon Wang: No, you are not, you are using Notebook.

293
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.770
Simon Wang: Oh, okay. So,

294
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.240
Simon Wang: Yeah, so let me, let me just show you how to do this.

295
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.470
Simon Wang: So, are we all good?

296
01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:04.589
Simon Wang: Now, if you are, on VS Code.

297
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:22.240
Simon Wang: on VS Code, you should have the two files opened, locally,

298
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:41.569
Simon Wang: And, if you are… On your tablet computer, You should have… an online VS Code environment.

299
01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.600
Simon Wang: Also got the two files.

300
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.030
Simon Wang: Downloaded.

301
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:50.829
Simon Wang: You know, by, cloning fork and clone.

302
01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.899
Simon Wang: the folders I provided through Moodle.

303
01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.820
Simon Wang: So either way, we should be able to start, doing a little bit of coding.

304
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:07.750
Simon Wang: Because… Right now, we have the CSV file, which is the data.

305
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.899
Simon Wang: And we also have a Jupyter Notebook.

306
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:16.450
Simon Wang: The Jupyter Notebook is an environment Where we can actually…

307
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:20.910
Simon Wang: Do a little bit of coding, And also to run it.

308
01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.420
Simon Wang: Okay?

309
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:25.819
Simon Wang: So, this is, this is,

310
01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:33.269
Simon Wang: an environment that, we can… we can do stuff. So, so actually, Talia, maybe you can start talking a little bit.

311
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.550
Simon Wang: about…

312
01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:39.470
Simon Wang: Okay.

313
01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.519
Simon Wang: We need…

314
01:01:55.790 --> 01:02:07.170
Simon Wang: Okay, so suppose, the, you have already installed the VS Code, and signed up your GitHub account, and also applied for the educational benefit.

315
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:12.420
Simon Wang: And also installed Python, so… Then we can,

316
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:17.840
Simon Wang: Move forward a little bit to talk about the interface that you just saw.

317
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:24.859
Simon Wang: Actually, it is called the Integrated Development Environment. So, basically, there are four main areas.

318
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:34.299
Simon Wang: On the left-hand side, it is a left panel. Basically, it is the, where your working directory is.

319
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:41.320
Simon Wang: So Simon just created a folder, which is called, like, GCAP3226,

320
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:48.639
Simon Wang: And you can download the CSV file and also the Jupyter Notebook into that file.

321
01:02:50.510 --> 01:03:01.889
Simon Wang: Let me… Switch to… So here, if you cannot see the left-hand side bar, You can click File.

322
01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.969
Simon Wang: And then, open folder.

323
01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:09.640
Simon Wang: Then select the folder you save all your course-related documents.

324
01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:13.060
Simon Wang: And then hit this select folder.

325
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:25.890
Simon Wang: So then, later, when you communicate with GitHub Copilot, you ask it to, say, load this data file, it will know where to find that data set.

326
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.259
Simon Wang: So this is your working directory.

327
01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:37.530
Simon Wang: Reported here, it will know Oh, I will go to this working directory to find the data set.

328
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:41.369
Simon Wang: So this is the live left-hand sidebar.

329
01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:54.379
Simon Wang: Then, in the middle, we have this middle panel, which is the editor area.

330
01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:58.569
Simon Wang: So then, we mainly, type prompt.

331
01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:03.470
Simon Wang: So the demand that you want GitHub Copilot to implement

332
01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:08.489
Simon Wang: and later some code generated by the GitHub Copilot.

333
01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:11.370
Simon Wang: So they will all show up in this middle panel.

334
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:18.480
Simon Wang: Then here, at the bottom, there is a bottom middle area, so it is terminal.

335
01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:25.750
Simon Wang: I think we won't, like, intentionally use this area, at least in this course.

336
01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:42.750
Simon Wang: And then, on the right-hand side, there is a right panel. Basically, you communicate with the GitHub Copilot, you, either ask questions or ask the agent to help you, implement your

337
01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:44.550
Simon Wang: Demand, or comment.

338
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.100
Simon Wang: So that is the four main areas of this interface.

339
01:04:52.620 --> 01:05:01.369
Simon Wang: And specifically, in VS Code, this is shown here, actually, on the left hand… on the most left-hand side, there is an activity bar.

340
01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.180
Simon Wang: So if we click this, you can open the working directory.

341
01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:16.030
Simon Wang: And another commonly used, area or icon is actually this one. There are four, squares.

342
01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:19.039
Simon Wang: So this is called the, extensions.

343
01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:26.599
Simon Wang: So if you want to install some, extra, extensions, you could click this and type the

344
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:28.200
Simon Wang: Extension name.

345
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.670
Simon Wang: So that those extensions can be installed.

346
01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:37.020
Simon Wang: And as mentioned, this editor pa… pens.

347
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:41.449
Simon Wang: As the middle area where we added, our code.

348
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:46.000
Simon Wang: or reads the code generated by the GitHub Copilot.

349
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:53.979
Simon Wang: So here is the, the bottom middle panel. It is the output and terminal.

350
01:05:54.170 --> 01:06:03.339
Simon Wang: Whereas on the right-hand side, there is, a right sidebar where you can communicate with your programming assistant.

351
01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:09.270
Simon Wang: And once you sign in the GitHub Copilot.

352
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:17.850
Simon Wang: In the VS Code, you will see this little icon. So this is an icon of the co-pilot. So you are the pilot.

353
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.910
Simon Wang: You are the one who decides what to do, whereas the,

354
01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:27.170
Simon Wang: the AI, the generative AI, works only as a co-pilot.

355
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:35.299
Simon Wang: So it implements your, You are demand. You are command about a task.

356
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.759
Simon Wang: So this is the overall interface.

357
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:47.570
Simon Wang: So you can see here is actually, an example of the Python script.

358
01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:51.549
Simon Wang: So the Python script ends with .py, right?

359
01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:56.850
Simon Wang: So maybe let's… maybe let's, quickly…

360
01:06:57.570 --> 01:07:01.760
Simon Wang: Gen… Create a new… Python script.

361
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:06.179
Simon Wang: So we can click File, and then New Text File.

362
01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:13.130
Simon Wang: And there will be, a new file or a new document called Untitled.

363
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:21.139
Simon Wang: And at this moment, it is just a text file. If you want to change it to a Python script.

364
01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:28.629
Simon Wang: We can click this… Button next to the… Next to the GitHub Copilot.

365
01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:31.700
Simon Wang: So at this moment, it should be plain text.

366
01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:40.280
Simon Wang: And if you click it, there will be a drop-down menu, and we can type Python.

367
01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:43.950
Simon Wang: And then select Python. It becomes Python.

368
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:54.220
Simon Wang: So then I, save it first, say I… Safe…

369
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:57.469
Simon Wang: I give you the name, maybe… hello?

370
01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:07.439
Simon Wang: Then you can see that hello.py shows up in this working directory.

371
01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.819
Simon Wang: And then we can write a very simple prompt.

372
01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:21.560
Simon Wang: By starting with a hashtag, So, I want to print… Hello, world.

373
01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.990
Simon Wang: So once I type this.

374
01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:34.699
Simon Wang: Prompt, starting with this hashtag, you can see that the ghost text shows up in the next line.

375
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:40.459
Simon Wang: It shows print, parentheses, Quotation mark, hello world.

376
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:47.679
Simon Wang: So as long as I… I know what I want to do, I want to print Hello World, then…

377
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.270
Simon Wang: I type it as a prompt, then…

378
01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.609
Simon Wang: the Python code is automatically generated.

379
01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.599
Simon Wang: And to accept it, you can either click this Accept.

380
01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.350
Simon Wang: Or hit the tab button on the keyboard.

381
01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:10.109
Simon Wang: So then it becomes a Python command.

382
01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:19.399
Simon Wang: So once we have this, we can run, we can run this code.

383
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:24.970
Simon Wang: By clicking this play or run button, here.

384
01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:26.640
Simon Wang: So if we run it…

385
01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.800
Simon Wang: It should… let me show the,

386
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:58.760
Simon Wang: Did we install Python in the computer?

387
01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.380
Simon Wang: Yeah, I think if the, Python is… You can try playing again.

388
01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.570
Simon Wang: Run? Yeah, run.

389
01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:14.600
Simon Wang: Does it work?

390
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:21.419
Simon Wang: No, I don't think we… I need to select Interpreter A.

391
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:35.720
Simon Wang: That means the Python is not yet… Installed, I think. But it says it's installed. Yeah, I think it's better to download it manually. I would think it's faster.

392
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.040
Simon Wang: Anyway…

393
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:47.650
Simon Wang: So if Python is already installed in your laptop, when you click this run button, there should be Hello World printed in this output area.

394
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.259
Simon Wang: So this is the code, and we run it, and we got some output.

395
01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.530
Simon Wang: So that's, basically, how it works.

396
01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:14.700
Simon Wang: That, depends on whether you have… whether we have installed the Adjuster Notebook Library, and also extension.

397
01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:21.240
Simon Wang: I think… Maybe later, when I show the Jupyter Notebook, I will give it a shot.

398
01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.280
Simon Wang: Okay.

399
01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:30.499
Simon Wang: So this is the VS Code interface, and about the Python script.

400
01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:34.979
Simon Wang: But in our course, we will mainly use this Jupyter notebook.

401
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:49.650
Simon Wang: Which is an interactive tool that led us to write and also run code, and also immediately view the results of the output, and also add notes.

402
01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.269
Simon Wang: So, in the, website version of Jupyter Notebook.

403
01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:01.629
Simon Wang: You can see that there are… These gray boxes.

404
01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:05.719
Simon Wang: So these gray boxes are, called cells.

405
01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:09.350
Simon Wang: Where we put, our code there.

406
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.589
Simon Wang: So, for example, we define a variable called X,

407
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:17.060
Simon Wang: X equals to 1 plus 1.

408
01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:29.640
Simon Wang: then we ask, hey, print out the value of X, then we just type print X, and then if we run this code cell, then the output will be 2.

409
01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.930
Simon Wang: So I print out the value.

410
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.169
Simon Wang: And similarly, if we define another new variable, which is called Y,

411
01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:43.300
Simon Wang: which equals to 2 times X, Then print Y.

412
01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:50.440
Simon Wang: And after we click the run button, this code is executed, And then the output.

413
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.280
Simon Wang: It returns 4, which is the value of 1.

414
01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.810
Simon Wang: So basically, we can immediately see the output of this program.

415
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:05.289
Simon Wang: And for a more complicated example, so suppose we have a data set.

416
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:12.330
Simon Wang: And we want to show the distribution of certain variables.

417
01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:17.339
Simon Wang: For example, we want to know the, in the dataset.

418
01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:22.250
Simon Wang: How this, average ticket price is distributed.

419
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:26.739
Simon Wang: Because there are many data points.

420
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:30.569
Simon Wang: So, I think, must be over 10,000 data points.

421
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:32.690
Simon Wang: We can use this histogram.

422
01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:38.119
Simon Wang: To show the overall distribution of ticket price in this dataset.

423
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:44.639
Simon Wang: So from this, histogram, it's a little bit…

424
01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:47.729
Simon Wang: small, how I can zoom in.

425
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:59.700
Simon Wang: So overall, this shape Mmm, this is not a symmetric Distribution, right?

426
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:09.130
Simon Wang: And we can see that The, typical values of the ticket price in this dataset is between

427
01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:14.509
Simon Wang: So here is about 600 And here is about 1,000.

428
01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:20.000
Simon Wang: So this means that the typical ticket price

429
01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:28.199
Simon Wang: In that data set, it's between this… it's within this range, from 6,000 to 1… 600 to 1,000.

430
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.660
Simon Wang: Yeah, and this is,

431
01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.300
Simon Wang: This is the distribution of the ticket price.

432
01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.660
Simon Wang: And there's only one peak.

433
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.639
Simon Wang: Generally speaking, there's only one peak.

434
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:56.059
Simon Wang: So there's no, like, extreme values, too much extreme values over, like, 1,200 or, near zero.

435
01:14:58.490 --> 01:15:03.679
Simon Wang: Whereas for another variable in this dataset, which is called the distance.

436
01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:11.340
Simon Wang: So the distribution of the value, you can see that it's quite different from the distribution of this ticket price.

437
01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:14.660
Simon Wang: For example, there are two peaks.

438
01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:17.689
Simon Wang: In this… in the second histogram.

439
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:26.769
Simon Wang: The first peak is when the value equals to zero. So you can see there are around 3,000 data points

440
01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:31.959
Simon Wang: Of this distance variable, the value equals to zero.

441
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:37.430
Simon Wang: So this is one typical value of distance in this dataset.

442
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:45.530
Simon Wang: And the other typical value is around 8,000, so this is the second peak, right?

443
01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:59.680
Simon Wang: And overall, this distribution is also not symmetric because of this, very large amount of zero values, right?

444
01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:06.370
Simon Wang: And that is the, another, like, kind of,

445
01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:12.140
Simon Wang: Variable. If we do the, histogram, we can see the distribution.

446
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:14.880
Simon Wang: Of the values of this variable.

447
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:23.140
Simon Wang: So, when we use Jupiter Notebook, we have the code to plot the histogram of different variables.

448
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:26.380
Simon Wang: We can immediately see the output.

449
01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:32.630
Simon Wang: like, in the, like, after the code.

450
01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:38.159
Simon Wang: We have the code, and we can immediately see the result. And if there's something wrong.

451
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:45.900
Simon Wang: If we find that, well, this visualization might not… that, might not be that appropriate.

452
01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:51.219
Simon Wang: Then we may change our code, and then, again, we can see the output immediately.

453
01:16:53.700 --> 01:17:04.589
Simon Wang: So that is, the… I think one of the reasons why Jupyter Notebook is actually quite commonly used in the, in either academia and industry.

454
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:08.789
Simon Wang: It can show the output, immediately.

455
01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:17.230
Simon Wang: And later, when we started to work on this Jupyter Notebook.

456
01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:21.689
Simon Wang: And when we try to run the code in these cold cells.

457
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:27.000
Simon Wang: the, VS Code will pop out an option.

458
01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.480
Simon Wang: which asks you to select your Python environment.

459
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:37.749
Simon Wang: So there's the top, manual, it's called Select Kernel.

460
01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:41.870
Simon Wang: And for this course, I would suggest

461
01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:47.699
Simon Wang: We just select the Python environments, Specifically, the global environment.

462
01:17:48.970 --> 01:17:53.710
Simon Wang: And only after we select the kernel, then the program will be run.

463
01:17:55.630 --> 01:18:01.429
Simon Wang: then what's… what… what is this kernel? What… what is the Heisen environment?

464
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:12.490
Simon Wang: So I will use this, analogy to, give you… try to give you a brief idea of what the Python kernel… actually, Jupyter kernel is.

465
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:22.750
Simon Wang: So when we select the Python environment, I think you just simply regard it as a restaurant.

466
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:28.269
Simon Wang: So a restaurant is, an example of environment, right?

467
01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:40.740
Simon Wang: Where the Jupyter Notebook is like the, is the front end, because we can see the notebook, and we can type code in that Jupyter Notebook.

468
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:47.409
Simon Wang: So you can imagine it as the dining area where you can place your order.

469
01:18:48.670 --> 01:18:53.689
Simon Wang: that I want to have, steak tonight, so I will order that one.

470
01:18:53.860 --> 01:19:01.649
Simon Wang: I put steak in my cold cell so that I can tell the kitchen that I want to… I want to eat steak, right?

471
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:10.009
Simon Wang: So you can regard the Python, the Jupyter notebook, as the dining area, we can… where you can place the order.

472
01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:18.330
Simon Wang: And then, the Python kernel, or the IPY kernel, so this package.

473
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:21.709
Simon Wang: Works like the, restaurant manager.

474
01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:25.639
Simon Wang: So you pass the, order.

475
01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:31.520
Simon Wang: to the kitchen via this Python kernel, via this restaurant manager.

476
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:40.029
Simon Wang: So he, the manager, they, do not only take care about your single order.

477
01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:44.059
Simon Wang: They will try to manage all of the orders together.

478
01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:46.790
Simon Wang: And also communicate with the chef.

479
01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:50.560
Simon Wang: Who really, cook the food you want.

480
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:57.590
Simon Wang: So the chef is the interpreter, Which is a program.

481
01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:07.100
Simon Wang: So you may imagine if the interpreter has a file name, It is ended by .exe.

482
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:10.890
Simon Wang: So the interpreter can be executed.

483
01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:18.570
Simon Wang: And it will be used to execute the, the, your, your order, to cook the food you want.

484
01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:28.030
Simon Wang: So once the manager, like, supervised the chef to really cook the food you want.

485
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:32.090
Simon Wang: They will only consider about what they have in the restaurant.

486
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:34.320
Simon Wang: Like the ingredients.

487
01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:46.930
Simon Wang: And then, after the food is ready, then the food is passed back to this restaurant manager, and then the restaurant manager will bring the food

488
01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:52.740
Simon Wang: To you, so that at the front end, you can see the output of the program.

489
01:20:55.250 --> 01:21:03.909
Simon Wang: So overall, this is the, like, a simplified version of what is, kernel means.

490
01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:14.289
Simon Wang: So, in development, in, like, software development, people may set up different Python environments for different projects.

491
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:22.389
Simon Wang: That will be helpful if there are, different versions of, like, Python libraries.

492
01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:34.210
Simon Wang: That will be easier for the, like, the, say, the software engineer to manage different, projects with different, like, Python library versions.

493
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:44.970
Simon Wang: But in our course, I think we… we don't need that complicated settings, so just focus on one global environment of Python.

494
01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:46.550
Simon Wang: And that will be fine.

495
01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:56.839
Simon Wang: So we… in this course, we only stick to one environment, and that is the global Python environment.

496
01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:04.679
Simon Wang: I think in the, when you try to run the, code cell in the Jupyter Notebook.

497
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:13.270
Simon Wang: And… There is a window pop-up to ask you to select the, the, the kernel.

498
01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.960
Simon Wang: Then you can see,

499
01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:30.679
Simon Wang: in one of the op… I think in one… any one of these options on the right-hand side, it has some, brief descriptions, whether it is global or whether it is virtual or something. So we would just stick…

500
01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:35.510
Simon Wang: to this global Python environment, and that will be good enough.

501
01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:47.789
Simon Wang: And, also, when we select kernel, do not go to the Jupyter server. Try to use local Python environment.

502
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.440
Simon Wang: So that is the… that are the two tips.

503
01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:13.259
Simon Wang: Okay, so, that is all about the, so, so far, that is all about the, setting, the technical part, the setting of the technical part. So then, I will give a, brief introduction to the data set that we will be working on.

504
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:20.339
Simon Wang: And as Simon mentioned, it is a data set about the survey.

505
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:28.170
Simon Wang: Regarding, citizens' opinion, About the municipal solid waste charging scheme.

506
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:41.440
Simon Wang: And actually, this charging scheme can date back to a long time ago, which is around the time when you were… when you were born, I think, so 2005.

507
01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.899
Simon Wang: So, dating back to 20 years ago.

508
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:50.810
Simon Wang: in one of the meetings in the Legislative Council.

509
01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:57.929
Simon Wang: Some members of this, Environmental Affairs Panel.

510
01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:06.380
Simon Wang: proposed that for Hong Kong, it is necessary to introduce the charging scheme for the municipal solid waste.

511
01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:10.220
Simon Wang: To provide incentive for sorting and recycling.

512
01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:14.400
Simon Wang: With the overall purpose to reduce the overall waste.

513
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:16.080
Simon Wang: generated.

514
01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:17.699
Simon Wang: In Hong Kong.

515
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:30.470
Simon Wang: And then, after around 10 years, so now time… the time goes to 2015, in another meeting.

516
01:24:31.670 --> 01:24:38.740
Simon Wang: It summarizes what, had been done in this Solid waste charging scheme.

517
01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:46.470
Simon Wang: So this panel, framework proposal for implementation of this charging scheme.

518
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:55.570
Simon Wang: It says that… The panel had already conducted an extensive public consultation in the past 3 years.

519
01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:05.860
Simon Wang: And the overall attitude of citizens towards this charging scheme is that majority support This charging scheme.

520
01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:12.860
Simon Wang: So they affirmed the introduction of a quantity-based municipal solid waste charging scheme in Hong Kong.

521
01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:28.340
Simon Wang: So the so-called quantity-based means that the more garbage the people dump, then the more amount of money, the amount of money they have to pay.

522
01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.999
Simon Wang: So it is like the, polluter-pay principle.

523
01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:36.650
Simon Wang: But that is… The meaning of the quantity-based.

524
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:47.350
Simon Wang: And it also mentioned that this will be one of the, like, major waste reduction initiatives under this Hong Kong blueprint.

525
01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:51.939
Simon Wang: For sustainable use of resources in this 10 years.

526
01:25:55.340 --> 01:26:00.910
Simon Wang: Then, after another 10 years, Everything looks different.

527
01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:07.150
Simon Wang: So, in a meeting in the middle of 2024,

528
01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:15.889
Simon Wang: in the title called The Way Forward to Municipal Solid Waste Charging and Other Waste Reduction and Management Measures.

529
01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:28.500
Simon Wang: It says that the Hong Kong government, which is cited as the administration here, the government advised that, taking into account a number of factors.

530
01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:37.979
Simon Wang: Including strong reservations about the implementation of this MSW charging by the majority of the public.

531
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:45.040
Simon Wang: So it turns out that the attitude of citizens just Turn around.

532
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:52.479
Simon Wang: totally reversed And people have, like, strong reservation about this, the implementation.

533
01:26:52.890 --> 01:27:00.010
Simon Wang: And then, the government decided to further defer the implementation of the MSW charging scheme.

534
01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:07.369
Simon Wang: And this is when the, our survey data was collected.

535
01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.119
Simon Wang: Because at that time, this decision was not made yet.

536
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:16.699
Simon Wang: So, at that time, one of, one student.

537
01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:23.470
Simon Wang: She is interested to know the overall level of support of citizens to this charging scheme.

538
01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:29.819
Simon Wang: And would like to explore the potential influencing factors of the level of support.

539
01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:39.499
Simon Wang: Then, the most recent, like, discussion about this, charging scheme

540
01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:45.900
Simon Wang: was under the topic of Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050.

541
01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:47.970
Simon Wang: It's a little bit weird to…

542
01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:51.519
Simon Wang: This topic is put under the climate action.

543
01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.790
Simon Wang: And it's cited that

544
01:27:54.950 --> 01:28:04.630
Simon Wang: The government was conducting an in-depth study on how to optimize this charging scheme, and intended to report the latest progress to the panel.

545
01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:06.600
Simon Wang: In mid-2025.

546
01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:16.189
Simon Wang: Actually, the overall, situation is that their scheme basically is, postponed indefinitely.

547
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:28.990
Simon Wang: So these information, Works like the overall context of… about this, municipal solid waste charging scheme.

548
01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:47.239
Simon Wang: So, as mentioned, this questionnaire is conducted by a previous student. She's a master's student, and now we have this link for the questionnaire. So, if you click the link on this slide.

549
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:50.899
Simon Wang: you can go to the… the Google Form.

550
01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:53.940
Simon Wang: That contains the whole questionnaire.

551
01:28:55.500 --> 01:29:03.509
Simon Wang: So last time, we only provided the QR code. It's not that friendly. This time, we provided this link.

552
01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.050
Simon Wang: So overall, as mentioned, the purpose

553
01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:16.830
Simon Wang: of this survey is to understand Hong Kong residents' awareness.

554
01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:24.469
Simon Wang: Attitudes, and also daily waste management behaviors related to the waste charging policy.

555
01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:29.259
Simon Wang: So, in total, there are 4 sections.

556
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:35.509
Simon Wang: The first section is about the overall level of support to this policy.

557
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:41.139
Simon Wang: And then the second part is about the, is from the behavioral level.

558
01:29:41.530 --> 01:29:46.150
Simon Wang: To measure the existing recycling behavior of citizens.

559
01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:57.729
Simon Wang: And the third part is about knowledge, so whether the participants are aware that the, municipal waste

560
01:29:58.570 --> 01:30:02.340
Simon Wang: problem is actually quite severe in Hong Kong.

561
01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:04.020
Simon Wang: So…

562
01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:13.879
Simon Wang: whether they know something about the situation, and whether they know something about recycling. What type of items can be recycled.

563
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:23.180
Simon Wang: And the last part is the demographic information, which is quite standard in this kind of survey.

564
01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:27.010
Simon Wang: Because intuitively, you would,

565
01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:36.040
Simon Wang: You would be, like, curious whether, like, people who have higher education level would be more likely to support this kind of

566
01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:39.979
Simon Wang: Environment protection policies.

567
01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:45.020
Simon Wang: So that's the overall four sections of this questionnaire.

568
01:30:46.570 --> 01:30:51.210
Simon Wang: And in the data file, in the CSV file.

569
01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:59.490
Simon Wang: All of the options are coded as numbers.

570
01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:04.039
Simon Wang: So, for example, the first column is called Support Level.

571
01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:11.259
Simon Wang: The one just represent, strongly, strongly oppose.

572
01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:15.630
Simon Wang: Whereas 5 represents strongly, support.

573
01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:20.440
Simon Wang: And, for example, the fairness.

574
01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:22.080
Simon Wang: the fairness.

575
01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:33.670
Simon Wang: means the perceived level of fairness of the policy. So whether the participant believes that this policy is fair to all of us.

576
01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:44.400
Simon Wang: Whereas 1 represents for, strongly not… strongly unfair, and 5 represents for strongly, strongly fair.

577
01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.200
Simon Wang: So on and so forth.

578
01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:59.519
Simon Wang: So later, we will work on some of these, variables to do the visualization, because still, numbers are a little bit hard to read.

579
01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:14.980
Simon Wang: Yep, I think that, is all about the slides, the content in the slides, and then I think we can move to the, Jupiter notebook.

580
01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:19.410
Simon Wang: So you can find it, again, from the, Moodle.

581
01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:24.030
Simon Wang: You can download it and save it into the working directory.

582
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:34.959
Simon Wang: It is strongly suggested to put the data document and also your Jupiter notebook under the same directory.

583
01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:42.450
Simon Wang: So that, when you load the data into the Python, it will be easier.

584
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:51.200
Simon Wang: So for this visualization task, there will be, I think 6 steps.

585
01:32:53.150 --> 01:33:00.429
Simon Wang: The first is just to load the, data into our, into Python.

586
01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:04.189
Simon Wang: And then, we will have a brief,

587
01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:11.750
Simon Wang: Understanding about the overall structure of this dataset, What variables it includes.

588
01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:18.140
Simon Wang: And then, use some commonly seen type of charts.

589
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:24.259
Simon Wang: Like, bar chart, pie chart, To visualize the categorical data.

590
01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:30.910
Simon Wang: And then for continuous data, or quantitative data, we can use histogram.

591
01:33:31.170 --> 01:33:37.849
Simon Wang: as what we have seen, and also this box whisker plot, which I will talk more about it next time.

592
01:33:38.170 --> 01:33:40.770
Simon Wang: To visualize this quantitative data.

593
01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:49.389
Simon Wang: Then, we can also explore the relationships between two variables using scatterplot.

594
01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:55.889
Simon Wang: And then we can save the, those, charts generated to our working directory.

595
01:33:56.490 --> 01:34:00.850
Simon Wang: But that will be the overall structure of this data visualization task.

596
01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:10.530
Simon Wang: So the first step is just to install and import the relevant libraries.

597
01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:18.620
Simon Wang: So as mentioned, the library just works as the ingredients in the kitchen, or the recipes of the food.

598
01:34:19.150 --> 01:34:24.489
Simon Wang: So it can help us to quickly, get the figures we want.

599
01:34:25.730 --> 01:34:31.009
Simon Wang: And specifically in this data visualization task, we will use this, pandas.

600
01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:37.219
Simon Wang: Which is a library related to the, data frame manipulation.

601
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:48.289
Simon Wang: And metaphotlib, which is a commonly used library to do the visualization, data visualization, and also Seaborn. Seabourn is also for visualization.

602
01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:59.530
Simon Wang: So if we have not installed these, libraries in the, in Python, Then we can… like…

603
01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:05.289
Simon Wang: Add a cold cell, so click this Lost Colt.

604
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:09.780
Simon Wang: So then a new, box shows up.

605
01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:15.590
Simon Wang: We can type code here, and specifically, we can run this

606
01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:23.340
Simon Wang: percentage sign, PIP install, pandas, MetLib Seabourn. So we can copy this.

607
01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:31.240
Simon Wang: And then run this cell. Run the code in this cell.

608
01:35:32.010 --> 01:35:38.159
Simon Wang: So this line will help us to install these three packages we will be using.

609
01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:48.160
Simon Wang: So the run button is just at the left-hand side of the cell… cell… Cold cell.

610
01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.830
Simon Wang: If you have not installed these libraries before, then…

611
01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:56.040
Simon Wang: You need to install the…

612
01:35:56.170 --> 01:35:59.559
Simon Wang: So that later we can import them and use them.

613
01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:07.000
Simon Wang: So, and after this installation, then we can,

614
01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:11.160
Simon Wang: Import these libraries for… for further use.

615
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:22.330
Simon Wang: So, in this… In this prompt, it just said, write a prompt to… to import pandas

616
01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:24.990
Simon Wang: And the two libraries.

617
01:36:25.890 --> 01:36:29.749
Simon Wang: then I can change this to write Python code.

618
01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:37.870
Simon Wang: to import pandas.

619
01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:40.080
Simon Wang: And the remaining 2.

620
01:36:42.970 --> 01:36:46.659
Simon Wang: So once I type this, prompt like this.

621
01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:51.599
Simon Wang: And when I hit enter, then the ghost tag shows up.

622
01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:57.539
Simon Wang: So this is the, the, the sentence.

623
01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:03.879
Simon Wang: that, in Python, To import the three libraries.

624
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.330
Simon Wang: So I just click tab to accept

625
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:11.799
Simon Wang: the suggestions made by GitHub Copilot.

626
01:37:13.530 --> 01:37:17.199
Simon Wang: Then these three lines will show up automatically.

627
01:37:17.670 --> 01:37:19.179
Simon Wang: And then I can run.

628
01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.970
Simon Wang: So here, I cannot run because

629
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:24.820
Simon Wang: As we mentioned, it is not correctly installed.

630
01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:30.789
Simon Wang: But in your laptop, This should be, running correctly.

631
01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:39.090
Simon Wang: So once we import these libraries, then we can load and, examine the dataset.

632
01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:48.589
Simon Wang: And to load it, I think we have already created this folder.

633
01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:53.169
Simon Wang: Saving the, documents in our, course.

634
01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.430
Simon Wang: And…

635
01:37:56.790 --> 01:38:07.899
Simon Wang: Then we can write a prompt to generate Python code that loads the CSV files into a Pandas data frame, and displays the first few rows, then run the code.

636
01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:16.369
Simon Wang: So then I can just… write code to load this DSV from the working directory into Pandas.

637
01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:18.390
Simon Wang: Show the first 5 rows.

638
01:38:20.350 --> 01:38:26.980
Simon Wang: You see, after I… Hit the enter, then there is a line.

639
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:35.589
Simon Wang: So although we haven't, learned much about Python, but I think it's still readable.

640
01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:40.529
Simon Wang: the pd.read… underscore CSV, so read CSV.

641
01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.720
Simon Wang: It's already quite,

642
01:38:44.050 --> 01:38:50.680
Simon Wang: It's quite like English, read CSV. Then there's a parentheses, then there is a file name.

643
01:38:51.670 --> 01:38:59.980
Simon Wang: And this… Data will be saved into a so-called data frame, called DF.

644
01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:06.100
Simon Wang: Okay, then I just… Hit the tab button.

645
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:10.829
Simon Wang: to make the suggestion to become a real Python command.

646
01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:19.130
Simon Wang: Then, it shows df.had, parentheses, So, because I asked

647
01:39:19.290 --> 01:39:23.119
Simon Wang: the, GitHub Copilot to display the first 5 rows.

648
01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:30.530
Simon Wang: Then this dot had, We'll make the, first 5 rows, to be printed.

649
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:33.940
Simon Wang: So again, I hit… HAB.

650
01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:39.890
Simon Wang: then this… line becomes a command, real command. I accept it.

651
01:39:41.230 --> 01:39:42.850
Simon Wang: then I can run.

652
01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:48.759
Simon Wang: And if everything goes smoothly, then the first 5 rows will be printed.

653
01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:05.920
Simon Wang: And then, the next step will be to understand the dataset structure and the variables Because…

654
01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:13.989
Simon Wang: Here, when we open this CSV file, there are quite many variables. There are many columns, right?

655
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:22.800
Simon Wang: then… They… these columns are, corresponding to the, the questions in the questionnaire.

656
01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:34.620
Simon Wang: So I want to, display the dataset information and generate some summary statistics, So if it's a…

657
01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.690
Simon Wang: Like, the,

658
01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:44.689
Simon Wang: Continuous, then what is the minimum value? What is the maximum value, what is the mean? What is the median?

659
01:40:44.810 --> 01:40:50.329
Simon Wang: I'm interested to know some basic information about my data.

660
01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:57.709
Simon Wang: And also, in case that I… I don't understand the…

661
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:03.380
Simon Wang: Python code generated by, GitHub Copilot, I asked.

662
01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:07.990
Simon Wang: I ask it to add comments explaining each line.

663
01:41:09.810 --> 01:41:13.269
Simon Wang: So instead of only, writing out these

664
01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:18.619
Simon Wang: comment, I also require the, comments.

665
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:24.739
Simon Wang: So that I can easily understand what that line of code means.

666
01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:32.070
Simon Wang: Then write prompt as a comment at the top of the next cell, then run the code.

667
01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:36.000
Simon Wang: Okay, so I will just remove this example.

668
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:38.919
Simon Wang: So this will… this will be my prompt.

669
01:41:39.210 --> 01:41:43.390
Simon Wang: Write code to display dataset information and summary statistics.

670
01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:44.640
Simon Wang: Ep.

671
01:41:45.170 --> 01:41:48.199
Simon Wang: Common lines to explain what each line of code does.

672
01:41:51.670 --> 01:41:53.779
Simon Wang: Then you can see the suggestion.

673
01:41:53.940 --> 01:42:01.730
Simon Wang: made by this GitHub co-pilot, instead of only have… having this, dab.info.

674
01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:06.340
Simon Wang: So this will show the… summarize the basic information of the data set.

675
01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:10.010
Simon Wang: It also has this… comment.

676
01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:13.300
Simon Wang: Starting with this hashtag.

677
01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:22.409
Simon Wang: So the sentence after the hashtag will not be executed. It is just a comment.

678
01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.950
Simon Wang: But this is for human, this is for the user.

679
01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:30.019
Simon Wang: If I want to, made some comments, or…

680
01:42:30.570 --> 01:42:37.369
Simon Wang: try to explain what this… what this df.info means, I can put the information after this hashtag.

681
01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:44.549
Simon Wang: So it says, display information about the dataset, including data types and non-null counts.

682
01:42:47.970 --> 01:42:49.720
Simon Wang: So this is what it means.

683
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.599
Simon Wang: Of this df.info.

684
01:42:54.630 --> 01:43:00.099
Simon Wang: And also, Because my requirement is to show the summary statistics.

685
01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:07.060
Simon Wang: This df.describe will display the summary statistics for numerical columns in the dataset.

686
01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:19.060
Simon Wang: And if I hit the tab, Then, these two…

687
01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:22.210
Simon Wang: Python command will become… become real.

688
01:43:25.730 --> 01:43:34.839
Simon Wang: I think, maybe, again, we have a 10-minute break first, and make sure that we… we're all on the same page to be able to

689
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.680
Simon Wang: Like, run the code up to Section 2.

690
01:44:03.850 --> 01:44:13.690
Simon Wang: I think, for VS Code, we have this option to click Auto Save, alright?

691
01:44:13.810 --> 01:44:22.719
Simon Wang: So, if you select auto-save, then, it will be auto-saved. Then you don't have to save every time.

692
01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:25.140
Simon Wang: So you might want to,

693
01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:31.869
Simon Wang: You might want to, enable this, check this, add item.

694
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:57.499
Simon Wang: Okay? And, let me check why it doesn't work.

695
01:44:59.910 --> 01:45:01.849
Simon Wang: Seems should be working, right?

696
01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:17.550
Simon Wang: So, we want to install and enable the extension. Maybe we can try that. Telly, is that your… should we, install this?

697
01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:20.500
Simon Wang: Install the extension?

698
01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:27.109
Simon Wang: It says, enable install the Python plus Jupyter.

699
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:29.140
Simon Wang: Okay.

700
01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:36.000
Simon Wang: Because, yeah, so… It's kind of funny, because if you used,

701
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:42.330
Simon Wang: If you use the online one, actually, it might be… it might be easier.

702
01:45:42.970 --> 01:45:44.169
Simon Wang: But what will we see.

703
01:45:45.190 --> 01:45:52.460
Simon Wang: So for those of you who are using, the online version.

704
01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:56.170
Simon Wang: You can also try the same.

705
01:45:59.410 --> 01:46:05.930
Simon Wang: Because what, Talia just demonstrated is the autocomplete approach.

706
01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:11.080
Simon Wang: Which is actually probably the most convenient one.

707
01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:16.410
Simon Wang: All you have to do is just, tell the…

708
01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:24.500
Simon Wang: You know, you write… you write some comments saying what you want to accomplish, and then through autocomplete.

709
01:46:24.710 --> 01:46:29.519
Simon Wang: the AI will, write the codes for you, and then you just run the codes, alright?

710
01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:41.190
Simon Wang: So, let me try again. We want to see… do we need to select the kernel?

711
01:46:44.050 --> 01:46:46.880
Simon Wang: Right, so now we have Python environment…

712
01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:50.890
Simon Wang: So we should, select a global environment, right?

713
01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:03.560
Simon Wang: So we just select the global environment. I think we still need to install the Python.

714
01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:12.750
Simon Wang: And once it is installed, Then we can run all the codes.

715
01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.170
Simon Wang: Starting from here…

716
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:21.160
Simon Wang: Okay.

717
01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:26.820
Simon Wang: So we need to install the, kernel.

718
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:34.589
Simon Wang: Yeah, I think this part is a little bit tricky, because everybody got its, their own, computers.

719
01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:45.619
Simon Wang: But, once we get past this, we should be in business. It should be quite straightforward.

720
01:47:46.530 --> 01:47:48.759
Simon Wang: So please be patient here.

721
01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:06.520
Simon Wang: I think we also got, some… Isoo here.

722
01:48:07.210 --> 01:48:09.809
Simon Wang: But let's see, if it will work.

723
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:13.870
Simon Wang: So, here, we just say, write Python…

724
01:48:43.050 --> 01:48:52.269
Simon Wang: Okay, so I'm not sure whether, autocomplete is working on the… on the, Codespace.

725
01:48:52.540 --> 01:49:02.050
Simon Wang: If it doesn't work, then we can, maybe go to ask more or agent mode. I mean, if it's agent mode, then it will be very,

726
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:04.290
Simon Wang: fast.

727
01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:09.510
Simon Wang: But, I think we can also just… Copy this…

728
01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:22.250
Simon Wang: And we send this instruction to, AI.

729
01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:26.169
Simon Wang: And we asked the AI to write some code.

730
01:49:34.890 --> 01:49:39.050
Simon Wang: So you see, this is already, written?

731
01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:44.459
Simon Wang: So what we do is, we can just, send it over.

732
01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:51.530
Simon Wang: Apply the code, Block here.

733
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:53.940
Simon Wang: So, we, we got this.

734
01:49:54.490 --> 01:50:00.459
Simon Wang: And then we can run it, right? I think we can run… How do you run this?

735
01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:08.289
Simon Wang: Right, so, so, so we have this code here.

736
01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:11.370
Simon Wang: And then we're gonna go ahead and run it.

737
01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:48.220
Simon Wang: I think they're still asking me for kernel.

738
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:38.150
Simon Wang: So actually, this is, what, what they suggest.

739
01:51:56.530 --> 01:52:03.180
Simon Wang: So, yeah, so AI, the AI agent is helping us to install, some of the

740
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:04.759
Simon Wang: Things we need.

741
01:52:05.290 --> 01:52:08.440
Simon Wang: So you can see now it's being imported.

742
01:57:01.690 --> 01:57:08.479
Simon Wang: Okay, so in my case, I think it is working now.

743
01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:16.540
Simon Wang: Because when I run the code.

744
01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:27.499
Simon Wang: It's… it's supposed to be working.

745
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:30.690
Simon Wang: And then we move on, because I'm on the…

746
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:36.540
Simon Wang: environment here, I'm not sure whether… it would…

747
01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:41.599
Simon Wang: Yeah, so it actually allowed me to do that, so it's just autocomplete like this.

748
01:57:42.370 --> 01:57:44.999
Simon Wang: Okay, and then I'm going to run.

749
02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:09.060
Simon Wang: So, have you got it working on your computer?

750
02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:14.020
Simon Wang: Nothing new?

751
02:01:14.230 --> 02:01:18.759
Simon Wang: Working for you? Which kernel do you use? Or you already got your Python installed?

752
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:24.100
Simon Wang: Oh, okay.

753
02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:41.129
Simon Wang: See, the thing is, I'm not sure… I mean, the whole Jupyter Notebook thing is, causing… making it, a bit more difficult. I think, what if we simply,

754
02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:45.240
Simon Wang: write some separate codes, I think that might work.

755
02:01:46.210 --> 02:01:50.520
Simon Wang: So, let me, let me, let me do a quick demo this way.

756
02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:03.640
Simon Wang: Didn't have that one.

757
02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:24.360
Simon Wang: Okay.

758
02:05:24.710 --> 02:05:28.230
Simon Wang: Finally, I cheated, sorry.

759
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:30.719
Simon Wang: I use the AI agent mode to make it work.

760
02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:37.770
Simon Wang: But I can, I can, I can share this, code with you.

761
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:46.629
Simon Wang: But, at least, we… we make it work, even though it's… it's a bit like cheating.

762
02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:54.340
Simon Wang: Okay, it works here as well.

763
02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:26.260
Simon Wang: Now, for students who are using tablet, computer on an online environment, before you close this.

764
02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:33.769
Simon Wang: you need to run the command line and say, commit, and push everything back to GitHub.

765
02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:36.590
Simon Wang: Because otherwise,

766
02:06:36.890 --> 02:06:44.770
Simon Wang: whatever you write here is just temporary. You may be lost… it will be lost, like, in, I don't know, 10 days or so.

767
02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:51.860
Simon Wang: Okay? But, Do you want to quickly take a look at what I just did?

768
02:06:52.310 --> 02:07:01.910
Simon Wang: Because, I'm… of course, I'm using, I'm using… Agent, So…

769
02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:11.699
Simon Wang: But I think this is also a good opportunity to kind of look at how Agent may be working.

770
02:07:12.370 --> 02:07:13.390
Simon Wang: Okay?

771
02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:25.410
Simon Wang: So, as you can see, this is the command line that I put.

772
02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:31.379
Simon Wang: what I did is I sent… this, Jupyter Notebook.

773
02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:36.650
Simon Wang: You see, we have this Jupyter Notebook, here.

774
02:07:36.930 --> 02:07:41.460
Simon Wang: I create a file path, Copy the past.

775
02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:48.569
Simon Wang: And I put it here, and then say, review the instruction and task here, and write separate Python files, then run and do all the tasks.

776
02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:55.460
Simon Wang: So, what the agent did is, you know, run the scripts…

777
02:07:55.770 --> 02:08:03.019
Simon Wang: and, generate all the scripts, and then, actually, they run… they write a Python code to run all the, scripts.

778
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:06.700
Simon Wang: And then we will get all the results.

779
02:08:07.410 --> 02:08:15.850
Simon Wang: Well… Of course, this is probably not the best pedagogical experience, because you just,

780
02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:19.810
Simon Wang: give it to AI to do everything.

781
02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:26.820
Simon Wang: In order to actually learn things, you have to come back and start reading some of the files.

782
02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:33.450
Simon Wang: But, you can see all these files are pretty well annotated.

783
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:40.130
Simon Wang: So, it actually explained to you what each… section is doing.

784
02:08:40.850 --> 02:08:47.569
Simon Wang: And then, we got all the results here. Distance analysis.

785
02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:55.539
Simon Wang: distance versus recycling, distance distribution, comparison. So, we got all the results here.

786
02:08:55.650 --> 02:08:57.980
Simon Wang: Now, my main…

787
02:08:58.450 --> 02:09:17.389
Simon Wang: point, I think this is going to be the most important message for today's session, you know, we spend a lot of time trying to figure things out, all the technical things, but that's actually not as important as the conceptual understanding, right? So the conceptual understanding is that we don't necessarily have to

788
02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:21.180
Simon Wang: Learn how to write these codes.

789
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:27.639
Simon Wang: you know, all these codes are actually in Python, before AI, if you…

790
02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:34.659
Simon Wang: travel back to 2021, for example, or 2022, before ChatGPT, before GenAI,

791
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:41.350
Simon Wang: Anyone who wants to generate this kind of, nice… the diagrams.

792
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:46.519
Simon Wang: from the codes here, we'll have to learn Python in the hard way.

793
02:09:46.710 --> 02:09:50.269
Simon Wang: So you have to start looking at, oh, okay, so…

794
02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:57.559
Simon Wang: What does import? What does import mean? Import is a function that, would actually,

795
02:09:57.770 --> 02:10:00.349
Simon Wang: Followed by some kind of package name.

796
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:05.960
Simon Wang: And then you have to define PD as a specific variable, You see what I mean?

797
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:21.060
Simon Wang: And then you look at this, okay, print, what does print mean? Print means, you know, you add some arguments or parameters into the parenthesis, and then the,

798
02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:27.860
Simon Wang: Python, the interpreter, will read these lines in order to do whatever we need to do. So.

799
02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:46.349
Simon Wang: So learning Python the hard way would be… you go through each line, you try to figure out what these lines mean, you type, you know, one character, character by character line by line, and then you run it, and you run into all kinds of bugs and errors, and you debug, and you spend hours to figure things out, and then you become a Python programmer.

800
02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:51.530
Simon Wang: Right? So that's how the conventional way of learning programming works.

801
02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:58.439
Simon Wang: But, now, with the AI agent, as you can see, all I did is just write one line.

802
02:10:59.150 --> 02:11:03.799
Simon Wang: And, and I got… we… we got all the files, figured out.

803
02:11:03.930 --> 02:11:10.019
Simon Wang: So, I think that's the power of vibe coding, and I hope you can recognize

804
02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:20.060
Simon Wang: There's, there's a huge, potential…

805
02:11:24.330 --> 02:11:29.989
Simon Wang: The huge potential of, being able to leverage the technology to create the codes.

806
02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:50.619
Simon Wang: Does it make sense?

807
02:12:01.130 --> 02:12:02.450
Simon Wang: Any question?

808
02:12:08.650 --> 02:12:15.720
Simon Wang: Shall we continue this, or maybe I can touch on the project topics?

809
02:12:19.310 --> 02:12:20.170
Simon Wang: Okay.

810
02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:26.919
Simon Wang: All right, so one more thing before I pass it over to, Talia is that.

811
02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:31.220
Simon Wang: If you are doing… this online.

812
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:33.840
Simon Wang: like, what I'm doing here.

813
02:12:39.210 --> 02:12:45.009
Simon Wang: For, for, for students who are doing it, on, On key hub.

814
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:47.960
Simon Wang: I mean, the, the online version.

815
02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:50.519
Simon Wang: Where is that?

816
02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:08.460
Simon Wang: Okay, so this is… This is the online version, right? So, so, so we got everything here.

817
02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:13.430
Simon Wang: We got all the, all the… The files and everything?

818
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:40.660
Simon Wang: So there's one thing you have to do, you have to say, commit, And, push.

819
02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:43.379
Simon Wang: to GitHub.

820
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:49.909
Simon Wang: Because right now, we are in a virtual environment, all the codes here are not being…

821
02:13:50.170 --> 02:13:56.779
Simon Wang: So you can see… The codes here, there's only the basic codes, right?

822
02:14:00.510 --> 02:14:05.610
Simon Wang: And, if you go to… Here…

823
02:14:05.930 --> 02:14:18.089
Simon Wang: You can see we have a code space, but then there's uncommitted changes, and that's not good, because that means the codes, the changes will be lost later.

824
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:22.239
Simon Wang: So what you have to do is to write commit and push to GitHub.

825
02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:30.460
Simon Wang: And you can ask agent to, run the command line.

826
02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:40.160
Simon Wang: So you can see… the agent is going to help you to commit and push everything to GitHub.

827
02:14:40.770 --> 02:14:41.580
Simon Wang: Alright.

828
02:15:51.110 --> 02:15:53.440
Simon Wang: So, as you can see here,

829
02:15:53.560 --> 02:16:00.869
Simon Wang: The agent is now doing all the command Run all the command lines.

830
02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:04.119
Simon Wang: And in order to compete and push everything.

831
02:16:05.110 --> 02:16:11.069
Simon Wang: Again, you know, even this kind of command line, you know, you have to learn the syntax before.

832
02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:13.800
Simon Wang: But now, it's all done.

833
02:16:14.410 --> 02:16:21.450
Simon Wang: And, you can check here… To see whether everything… is already committed.

834
02:16:22.780 --> 02:16:23.700
Simon Wang: Not yet.

835
02:16:24.630 --> 02:16:27.310
Simon Wang: So, you have to… Wait a bit.

836
02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:47.809
Simon Wang: But anyway, so that's kind of a reminder for you. If you are using your

837
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:52.699
Simon Wang: Wait, it should be working now, right?

838
02:16:53.370 --> 02:16:56.619
Simon Wang: How come it's not, committed?

839
02:17:16.250 --> 02:17:23.009
Simon Wang: Okay, anyway, I'll try to fix it myself, but, yeah, Talia, maybe you can talk a bit more about…

840
02:17:44.850 --> 02:17:53.029
Simon Wang: Yeah, okay, I think we have finished the two… first two sessions, and I will quickly go through the remaining

841
02:17:53.559 --> 02:17:54.940
Simon Wang: four sections.

842
02:17:55.370 --> 02:17:59.909
Simon Wang: Actually, the Section 3 is for categorical data visualization.

843
02:18:00.190 --> 02:18:07.869
Simon Wang: And example of categorical data is, like, the, all the, options about opinion, like.

844
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:18.640
Simon Wang: To what extent you support, this policy, or to, to… to what extent do you think this policy would be effective?

845
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:22.880
Simon Wang: For, like, reducing the weight, so on and so forth.

846
02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:27.920
Simon Wang: As long as it's… a Likert scale, like, from 1 to 5.

847
02:18:28.090 --> 02:18:31.639
Simon Wang: Then we can regard it as a categorical data.

848
02:18:32.969 --> 02:18:40.440
Simon Wang: And for the categorical data, it's usually used as either bar chart or pie chart to do the visualization.

849
02:18:42.379 --> 02:18:48.200
Simon Wang: So here, I actually typed the, relevant prompts already.

850
02:18:48.639 --> 02:18:55.179
Simon Wang: For example, write Python code to create a frequency table for the level support variable.

851
02:18:56.129 --> 02:19:02.299
Simon Wang: So because this is the, I think, one of the variables that we care most.

852
02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:09.490
Simon Wang: Because we want to know how… how many percent of people would like to support this scheme.

853
02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:15.649
Simon Wang: So, I want to, generate a frequency table.

854
02:19:15.799 --> 02:19:22.259
Simon Wang: To show the numbers, and then later, to create a bar chart, For the support level.

855
02:19:23.059 --> 02:19:27.239
Simon Wang: I think the outcome… Should look like this.

856
02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:33.500
Simon Wang: So the, it seems that the, majority of people still support their scheme.

857
02:19:34.219 --> 02:19:38.339
Simon Wang: On the x-axis, there are different, categories.

858
02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:46.889
Simon Wang: Where on the y-axis, it represents the frequency, or the count, the number of people who select the corresponding option.

859
02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:57.119
Simon Wang: We can also use this pie chart to show the percentages of different groups.

860
02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:01.819
Simon Wang: Let me see whether I can find the,

861
02:20:02.950 --> 02:20:12.720
Simon Wang: Yeah, so if you, like, modify the… Given prompt, And generate the code, To plot this pie chart.

862
02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:14.630
Simon Wang: It may look like this.

863
02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:20.369
Simon Wang: So, but of course, some details of the pie chart might be different.

864
02:20:20.620 --> 02:20:27.880
Simon Wang: Because, as mentioned last time, the answer given by LLM is not deterministic.

865
02:20:28.210 --> 02:20:30.540
Simon Wang: It contains certain random part.

866
02:20:30.810 --> 02:20:37.329
Simon Wang: And even you ask it the same question today and tomorrow, the answer will not be exactly the same.

867
02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:55.469
Simon Wang: So similar here, the code it generates in my computer might not be exactly the same with the code generated on your… in your computer. So it is possible that all… the looking of the charts are not exactly the same. But overall, like, the percentages must be the same.

868
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:08.680
Simon Wang: And I think for the, following, this, these are called the, marked down cells.

869
02:21:08.970 --> 02:21:14.770
Simon Wang: Sorry, these are still the cold cells, but for, like, more tasks.

870
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:19.970
Simon Wang: like this cell, this is a marked-down cell, so you can see that

871
02:21:20.260 --> 02:21:27.119
Simon Wang: If I click this button, I can add new markdown cells to this notebook.

872
02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:34.019
Simon Wang: And in Markdown Cell, I can, type the text with formatting.

873
02:21:34.460 --> 02:21:38.970
Simon Wang: So, for example, for these more tasks, it's bold, right? He's bolded.

874
02:21:39.730 --> 02:21:44.509
Simon Wang: And for this food waste behavior, it's somewhat highlighted, right?

875
02:21:44.830 --> 02:21:49.490
Simon Wang: And this can all be, formatted

876
02:21:49.730 --> 02:21:53.300
Simon Wang: By this, using this markdown format.

877
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:57.820
Simon Wang: So, say, if I add the, asterisks.

878
02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:05.740
Simon Wang: Two asterisks, in front of, and after there's more tasks, it will be… it will be… become bold.

879
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:18.120
Simon Wang: So you may, play with this prompt and see how this, Python code were, are generated.

880
02:22:20.060 --> 02:22:27.960
Simon Wang: So here comes more, but I think we do not have time to… Go through them in details.

881
02:22:29.010 --> 02:22:33.079
Simon Wang: And then the Section 4 is about the continuous data.

882
02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:42.059
Simon Wang: So this type of data is different from the categorical data, which, like, can only group the individuals into groups.

883
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:49.519
Simon Wang: There's only, I think, one continuous data in our dataset, which is called the distance.

884
02:22:49.710 --> 02:22:59.049
Simon Wang: Which measures the distance between the participant's apartment to the nearest recycling facility.

885
02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:08.179
Simon Wang: So whether it is 100 meters, 150 meters, like, 210 meters, That is, quantitative data.

886
02:23:08.770 --> 02:23:13.289
Simon Wang: Which gives you a numerical measurement of the distance between

887
02:23:13.410 --> 02:23:18.069
Simon Wang: Where the participants leave, and the nearest recycling facilities.

888
02:23:19.780 --> 02:23:26.540
Simon Wang: And the reason that I mentioned this type of data is different compared to the previous is because

889
02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:31.190
Simon Wang: The type of visualization depends on the data type.

890
02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:40.709
Simon Wang: So previously, when we have categorical data, we use bar chart, right? We use pie chart.

891
02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:49.829
Simon Wang: Whereas for the continuous data type, we often use histogram to show the distribution, or use the box and whisker plot.

892
02:23:50.430 --> 02:23:55.230
Simon Wang: So at least the type of data will determine which…

893
02:23:55.630 --> 02:23:59.690
Simon Wang: Which type of visualization is the most appropriate one?

894
02:24:02.370 --> 02:24:13.099
Simon Wang: So for this continuous data, we can, simply ask GitHub Compiler to, write code to generate histogram or box whisker plot.

895
02:24:13.730 --> 02:24:19.559
Simon Wang: And then once the code is generated, then we can run and see the output immediately.

896
02:24:22.050 --> 02:24:27.119
Simon Wang: And Section 5 is about exploring the relationship between variables.

897
02:24:27.330 --> 02:24:38.559
Simon Wang: say… If we want to know whether the longer the distance between home and the nearest recycling facilities.

898
02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:42.609
Simon Wang: The less recycling effort the participant will pay.

899
02:24:43.220 --> 02:24:50.769
Simon Wang: If we want to explore the relationship between these two variables, then we can use this scatter plot.

900
02:24:53.470 --> 02:24:58.010
Simon Wang: And the last part is, once we generate this, like,

901
02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:05.790
Simon Wang: plots, we may want to save them into our, Like, working directory.

902
02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:16.979
Simon Wang: So again, we can ask GitHub Copilot to generate code, and save them under the same folder called plots, so that later, when we want to

903
02:25:17.140 --> 02:25:23.650
Simon Wang: Say, use this charts in our, say, presentations, and we can easily

904
02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:26.579
Simon Wang: Paste them to, to our slides.

905
02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:40.149
Simon Wang: Yeah, I think that will be all of the visualization part, and for specific visualizations, like box and whisker plot, I will spend some more time next week.

906
02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:49.850
Simon Wang: Then I will pass the mic back to Simon to briefly introduce about the, our course projects.

907
02:25:53.730 --> 02:26:02.149
Simon Wang: Alright, so, I hope you are not too overwhelmed by what we did here.

908
02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:12.790
Simon Wang: And there, you know, we'll have plenty of time to figure things out, so even if it doesn't work on your computer, don't worry, we will come back to this.

909
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:27.239
Simon Wang: Now, I want to very briefly talk about the projects that we, plan to pursue, because this is an experiential learning course, so we are going to spend a little bit, well, actually.

910
02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:35.049
Simon Wang: The bulk of the time that we're going to spend, in this semester is to pursue, good projects.

911
02:26:35.690 --> 02:26:40.639
Simon Wang: And, well, this semester, we are actually very lucky.

912
02:26:40.780 --> 02:26:44.069
Simon Wang: Because we have a relatively small class size.

913
02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:56.700
Simon Wang: That means you will enjoy the luxury of having a remarkable teacher-student ratio, right? Last semester, we got,

914
02:26:57.620 --> 02:27:16.960
Simon Wang: almost 30 students, right? More than 30 students. So you can imagine how hard it was for two of us to supervise, six projects. And each project team got, up to 5, sometimes 7, students. So it's, it's a lot of more work of supervision.

915
02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:20.009
Simon Wang: But this semester, it's much better now.

916
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:28.370
Simon Wang: But, actually, I would, encourage you to stay in this course. If you are thinking about dropping or whatever, think again.

917
02:27:28.650 --> 02:27:39.319
Simon Wang: Because, again, as I said, you know, we have very, kind of luxurious, kind of, access to, to a lot of material, resources, support.

918
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:42.860
Simon Wang: Now, if you come to the group projects.

919
02:27:43.460 --> 02:27:46.670
Simon Wang: tab, you can see we have this,

920
02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:51.480
Simon Wang: We have this, sidebar.

921
02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:57.750
Simon Wang: So if you go to Google Project, we have a total of… 6 options.

922
02:27:57.890 --> 02:27:58.810
Simon Wang: Alright?

923
02:27:59.010 --> 02:28:03.859
Simon Wang: And obviously, we don't need 6 projects. I'm thinking about 2.

924
02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:12.220
Simon Wang: Or maybe up to three, right? Two to three projects that we're going to pursue, this semester.

925
02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:20.290
Simon Wang: Assuming that we're going to have this many students, I don't know, maybe, you know, tomorrow a couple more will show up.

926
02:28:20.530 --> 02:28:27.209
Simon Wang: But, most likely, we're going to have 3 project teams. Each team, we're talking about 3

927
02:28:27.340 --> 02:28:31.889
Simon Wang: Or 4 students, or if we have 2 project teams, then, you know, 4 or 5.

928
02:28:32.390 --> 02:28:34.629
Simon Wang: I think that's a really nice setting.

929
02:28:34.890 --> 02:28:49.390
Simon Wang: So, what I'm going to do is just very quickly give you a kind of an overview of some of the projects here. I don't even will go into the individual pages, just a kind of a sweeping kind of overview.

930
02:28:49.630 --> 02:28:57.500
Simon Wang: Flu shots is a public health, manner, so every year we are facing seasonal influenza.

931
02:28:57.590 --> 02:29:10.759
Simon Wang: it can become very serious. Some people will, you know, unfortunately die from it, and the entire healthcare system is overwhelmed. Public hospitals, emergency rooms with long queues.

932
02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:18.669
Simon Wang: But the government is trying to promote flu shots every year, but the participation rate is still not good enough.

933
02:29:19.090 --> 02:29:26.680
Simon Wang: So, if you pursue this project, we're going to investigate how the government can do a better job to promote flu shots, to protect public health.

934
02:29:27.010 --> 02:29:37.620
Simon Wang: And there's a team last semester who already did this a little bit, you know, but I think we can continue working on this, so that's the first project.

935
02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:43.600
Simon Wang: Column Cancer Screening Program, it's a…

936
02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:57.899
Simon Wang: preventive project, a preventive scheme. So basically, anyone who are over 50 years old in Hong Kong can join the scheme, as long as they don't have these colon cancer symptoms.

937
02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:07.870
Simon Wang: And, the idea is that if we can diagnose the cases earlier, then we're going to save public health resources.

938
02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:11.139
Simon Wang: Now, if you only work on this.

939
02:30:11.710 --> 02:30:18.909
Simon Wang: we can provide support, and also, I had some students who did some work before, so we can build upon this.

940
02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:32.929
Simon Wang: Now, road safety is a completely different category. Now we're talking public transportation. We only have some data from the Hong Kong Police, as well as Transport Department, looking at how they identify what we call the black site.

941
02:30:33.010 --> 02:30:49.180
Simon Wang: You know, those are the places where accidents are more likely to happen, all right? So we want to review to what extent this kind of black site scheme would actually help improve the road condition and reduce the risk of accidents.

942
02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:59.970
Simon Wang: Alright, so again, that's a very, kind of, practical project, and the outcome of this kind of project will create value for our community and society.

943
02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:15.480
Simon Wang: EMPF, NPF is the Hong Kong's retirement scheme, okay? Everybody is, required, anyone who works in Hong Kong are required to join this, mandatory providence, fund.

944
02:31:15.530 --> 02:31:28.029
Simon Wang: It's, you know, you have to contribute, like, up 5% of your salary every month, and your boss, your employer, will contribute another 5%. You know, some, some employers will contribute more.

945
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:48.540
Simon Wang: And, recently, the government introduced this eMPF platform that aims to streamline the process of managing the fund, okay? And promises to reduce the fees, management fee. Now, we're going to request some data from NPF Authority.

946
02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:55.919
Simon Wang: And to evaluate to what extent this platform is actually making a difference, and how we can further improve the platform.

947
02:31:56.030 --> 02:32:04.660
Simon Wang: Now, again, it's very practical, it's, it's got, practical value for the community, but probably not so,

948
02:32:05.170 --> 02:32:14.020
Simon Wang: I mean, it may be less relevant to young people, because, you know, your retirement is still on the horizon, you know, not on the horizon, it's still many years…

949
02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:15.350
Simon Wang: this away.

950
02:32:15.450 --> 02:32:21.999
Simon Wang: But still, it's… it's kind of relevant to people who are going to work anyway, so… so that's… that's that.

951
02:32:22.290 --> 02:32:36.380
Simon Wang: And chronic disease co-care pilot scheme is a little bit related to this, because both are public health, but this one is to offer people the opportunity to actually see the private doctors with government subsidies.

952
02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:39.850
Simon Wang: For certain chronic conditions, like hypertension.

953
02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:54.130
Simon Wang: what's the other one? Hypertension and diabetes, all right? So that's, again, we need to look at, the participation rate, we need to look at whether, to what extent these, schemes are making a difference for the public health sector.

954
02:32:54.700 --> 02:32:59.360
Simon Wang: Rodent control, that's a different one.

955
02:32:59.570 --> 02:33:07.419
Simon Wang: So, the government has got some schemes to try to keep the number of rodents in different communities under control.

956
02:33:07.450 --> 02:33:23.839
Simon Wang: And we want to look at how the government is assessing the situation, and to what extent this scheme is effective in terms of monitoring and also controlling this rodents or, you know, mice or rats.

957
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:25.540
Simon Wang: In our neighborhood.

958
02:33:26.170 --> 02:33:29.909
Simon Wang: And finally, we have this project on bus stop merch.

959
02:33:30.250 --> 02:33:48.430
Simon Wang: And, this is actually a… a very kind of neighborhood issue. So, in… actually, this is a neighborhood where I live. We found that there are two bus stops only about 50… 50 or 75 meters away, apart. So, we're trying to make the argument that the two bus stops should be merged.

960
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:58.139
Simon Wang: Because right now, all the buses that, especially during the rush hours, all the buses have to stop at both spots, creating a queue

961
02:33:58.300 --> 02:34:09.070
Simon Wang: Right? And, because they're, you know, passengers have to get on the bus, and that would take time, the bus stop space is very limited.

962
02:34:10.330 --> 02:34:15.710
Simon Wang: So we're trying to, look at, the possibility of, merging

963
02:34:15.930 --> 02:34:18.959
Simon Wang: These two bus stops, making the argument.

964
02:34:19.570 --> 02:34:25.380
Simon Wang: Now, if you go to the fall 2025, archive.

965
02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:34.480
Simon Wang: You can see that, actually, for both flu shots and bus stop merge, the teams have already done some work.

966
02:34:34.730 --> 02:34:37.729
Simon Wang: So you can actually get a taste on, you know.

967
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:46.340
Simon Wang: what they have done, and then we can build upon that. So, for flu shots, and for, bus stop merging.

968
02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:51.870
Simon Wang: We actually have something which is, quite interesting.

969
02:34:52.350 --> 02:34:59.779
Simon Wang: But again, it's up to you, and hopefully you guys can actually come up with something.

970
02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:03.609
Simon Wang: Let me see if I have that simulation link.

971
02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:06.900
Simon Wang: We probably don't have the simulation link, right?

972
02:35:09.220 --> 02:35:16.990
Simon Wang: Anyway, so, I hope that that makes sense. I think that's pretty much, all I have to say for now.

973
02:35:21.850 --> 02:35:23.870
Simon Wang: Right, okay, hold on.

974
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:30.180
Simon Wang: Okay, so going back here… So, any quick…

975
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:33.909
Simon Wang: Questions? Because we still got a few minutes left.

976
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:39.849
Simon Wang: Any quick questions about any of these projects? Any project that you find particularly interesting?

977
02:35:40.300 --> 02:35:57.419
Simon Wang: Obviously, we don't want students to spread over different projects. We want to narrow down the scope to two, or up to three projects, so that's why I would encourage you guys to

978
02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:04.849
Simon Wang: Reply my message, in the… In a group.

979
02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:06.770
Simon Wang: Okay?

980
02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:12.649
Simon Wang: So, I, I would just go ahead and, and, Take a picture.

981
02:36:13.450 --> 02:36:19.620
Simon Wang: And, as you can see, in the group, we've… we've got all the seven… Projects.

982
02:36:19.970 --> 02:36:21.320
Simon Wang: project ideas.

983
02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:25.830
Simon Wang: And you go ahead and reply and let us know which one

984
02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:30.039
Simon Wang: would you like to pursue? What's your first choice? What's your second choice? How about that?

985
02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:34.770
Simon Wang: And then we will have some idea, you know, which…

986
02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:41.920
Simon Wang: topics we want to pursue, okay? So I think, you know, we have plenty of options here.

987
02:36:42.030 --> 02:36:46.739
Simon Wang: So, I hope you guys can, give… give it some thoughts.

988
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:53.640
Simon Wang: And when we come back, next Wednesday, we will start, you know, finalizing the group

989
02:36:53.900 --> 02:37:04.879
Simon Wang: information and topics, and we will start, reviewing all the information that is publicly available, and we will start planning, you know, collecting some data from the government.

990
02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:18.780
Simon Wang: And, also collecting data so we can run the math model to, to do some analysis, okay? So, and of course, the VIP coding and computers tools are here.

991
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:20.879
Simon Wang: To, to, to help.

992
02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:25.909
Simon Wang: And for those of you who haven't got the notebook computer.

993
02:37:26.010 --> 02:37:34.390
Simon Wang: This time, I hope next week you can bring your notebook computer, because that would be actually much more, convenient, alright?

994
02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:39.190
Simon Wang: So, any questions?

995
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:43.650
Simon Wang: Any questions?

996
02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:58.060
Simon Wang: I have no idea why I cannot, commit.

997
02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:05.079
Simon Wang: my codes. Oh, okay, so now it's actually committed.

998
02:38:09.690 --> 02:38:13.089
Simon Wang: But still, it's not… it's not being committed. I don't know why.

999
02:38:13.850 --> 02:38:17.030
Simon Wang: Anyway, so, any questions?
