1
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.510
Simon Wang: Alright, so, huh.

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.349
Simon Wang: This is the second semester that we teach this course, which is,

3
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.679
Simon Wang: Kind of different from last semester, you know?

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:32.599
Simon Wang: In the last semester, we had quite, like, a room full of students, but right now, we don't have that many. But, hopefully we'll have more, so this video recording will be shared with students.

5
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:41.399
Simon Wang: And when you watch the video, you can also know more about this course. And we have a QR code, so maybe you guys can…

6
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.920
Simon Wang: Scan the QR code, and

7
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.059
Simon Wang: You'll be able to have this page.

8
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.250
Simon Wang: Okay.

9
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.819
Simon Wang: You only do that? Scan the QR code.

10
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.629
Simon Wang: Alright, so this is a GCAP course. It's a new GCAP course.

11
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.040
Simon Wang: And, as the title suggests.

12
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.810
Simon Wang: We are trying to empower citizens through data.

13
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.700
Simon Wang: Alright? And, it's called Participatory Policy Analysis.

14
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.500
Simon Wang: for Hong Kong.

15
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:28.210
Simon Wang: Now, obviously, we want to focus on some public policy issue in Hong Kong, And the word participatory

16
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:40.669
Simon Wang: implies that we want to participate, alright, as ordinary citizens. We want to join the discussion, join the conversation, and hopefully, we will be able to

17
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.350
Simon Wang: influence the behaviors and the decision-making process of the Hong Kong government.

18
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.060
Simon Wang: And, that's very difficult.

19
00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:01.630
Simon Wang: Because the government has its own way of doing things, and they make a lot of decisions, and the process is not always transparent.

20
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.910
Simon Wang: And, I think the, kind of the long-term vision and the goal is for us to try to change that.

21
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:18.180
Simon Wang: Alright, because we won't… the government staff to be more transparent about how they make decisions. And hopefully.

22
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.480
Simon Wang: They can use more data.

23
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.590
Simon Wang: when they make decisions on public policies. So that's our goal.

24
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:34.330
Simon Wang: And, our team, the teaching team is very unique, because we have, the math teacher.

25
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.610
Simon Wang: Dr. Wu here, Talia.

26
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.330
Simon Wang: She's the coordinator, because the course is offered by math department, and I'm the co-teacher from the language center, so this is going to be…

27
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.400
Simon Wang: The kind of a synergy between the quantitative reasoning and the qualitative, reasoning.

28
00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:09.580
Simon Wang: And I think that's a very unique combination, and for students who take this course, even though we will be doing some math, we'll be doing some modeling, we don't really expect the students to have very strong math background.

29
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:20.680
Simon Wang: Because, this is actually a general education course. So we try to design and present the materials in a way that students from different backgrounds can all benefit.

30
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.640
Simon Wang: Right?

31
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.230
Simon Wang: Now, in terms of course objectives.

32
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.500
Simon Wang: There are 4 items, or 4 themes, that we want to cover.

33
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:49.270
Simon Wang: The first one is, we're going to offer some analytical tools, alright? Again, you know, we want to emphasize the fact that we don't really expect you to have math background, but it seems like most of you have some background in math. By the way, what's your major?

34
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.090
Simon Wang: Oh, you're a math major! Okay, great.

35
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.210
Simon Wang: Right, so…

36
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:15.769
Simon Wang: even though you're not very familiar with all the math models and everything, the good news is that now we have artificial intelligence, we have AI, large language model, can bridge the gap between people who do not have such a background and those who have the background. And specifically, we want to…

37
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.939
Simon Wang: Adopt this approach called, vibe coding.

38
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.259
Simon Wang: Okay, so, raise your hand if you tried VIP coding before.

39
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.360
Simon Wang: Yeah?

40
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.740
Simon Wang: How about you?

41
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.640
Simon Wang: No?

42
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.190
Simon Wang: Have you done any programming before?

43
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.230
Simon Wang: Python, Elizabeth, how about you?

44
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.650
Simon Wang: R, okay, that's for, statistical analysis, great.

45
00:04:46.820 --> 00:05:03.240
Simon Wang: So, yeah, so the idea of vibe coding is that you don't necessarily have to learn the syntax itself. As long as you know, you know, what you want with the codes, then you can ask the AI to write the code and run it, and you can see whether the result is good.

46
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.709
Simon Wang: even if there's some syntax, error or whatever, you know, the AI can actually help us to, to,

47
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.689
Simon Wang: fix it.

48
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:27.520
Simon Wang: So, okay, so hopefully there will be a couple of tools that you will pick up from this course, and you can apply it to problem solving, and you will be able to, you know, use it in your future, studies and career.

49
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.109
Simon Wang: Now, the second theme we want to emphasize in this course is called, government transparency and accountability.

50
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.970
Simon Wang: And specifically, we want to look at how the government staff make decisions.

51
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:50.490
Simon Wang: Because one of the assumptions in this course is that we believe data should play the central role in decision-making process.

52
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:59.979
Simon Wang: Alright? Because we believe that the best way to make decisions is to look at the data, instead of just based on experience or intuition.

53
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.450
Simon Wang: Or, stakeholders' opinion.

54
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:15.550
Simon Wang: But, to what extent the government staff is actually making decisions based on data? That's the question we want to ask, the question we want to actually, collect some data from.

55
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:26.289
Simon Wang: So, in other words, what we're going to do is we will write email to the specific government department staff and ask them questions about how they make decisions.

56
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.150
Simon Wang: Alright?

57
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:38.000
Simon Wang: And, you know, you may wonder, why should the government staff actually Respond to, our questions.

58
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:45.940
Simon Wang: Well, actually, we're going to talk about this a little bit later, but we have something called Code on Access to Information.

59
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.210
Simon Wang: Alright?

60
00:06:47.810 --> 00:07:02.909
Simon Wang: So, code on access to information is one of the tools we're going to introduce in this course. Actually, it's more qualitative, because we're going to just write email to the government staff. And the government staff will have to answer our questions in three weeks.

61
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:09.499
Simon Wang: Okay? And, those answers hopefully will help us to better,

62
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:20.220
Simon Wang: Understand how they make decisions, and to what extent they are using the data, and also what kind of data is actually available.

63
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:32.899
Simon Wang: Okay, so this would be a very important part of this course, and also we try to align our projects with some of the SDGs.

64
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.840
Simon Wang: Okay.

65
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.920
Simon Wang: Now…

66
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:57.259
Simon Wang: The third item I want to, cover regarding the silo, regarding the course objectives, is experiential learning, all right? Because it is an experiential learning course. We don't just, you know, stay in the classroom and do all the theoretical stuff.

67
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:05.989
Simon Wang: or talk about the books. Instead, we are trying to apply some skills and techniques and try to solve a real-world problem.

68
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:13.280
Simon Wang: Alright? And we are going to conduct some fieldwork, and we're going to collect some, primary empirical data.

69
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:22.889
Simon Wang: Alright? And again, our ambition is that, what we're going to do will create real work impact.

70
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.439
Simon Wang: For example, last semester, we, did a project on flu shots.

71
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:43.759
Simon Wang: So, it's a vaccination program, right? And our goal is to evaluate the government's approach and government's decision-making process regarding the seasonal influenza vaccination program.

72
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:53.609
Simon Wang: And hopefully we'll have students to continue doing this project, because I think this is an ongoing kind of battle against the disease.

73
00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:04.229
Simon Wang: And we also have the plan to submit our reports to the Legislative Council, alright, to engage the lawmakers, to engage different stakeholders.

74
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:10.150
Simon Wang: And if you are interested, you can also check out some of the students' work.

75
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:16.659
Simon Wang: from, last semester. You can see that we have one team work on flu shot.

76
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.520
Simon Wang: They did the presentation.

77
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:25.740
Simon Wang: And, another team working on… working on, bus routes.

78
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.240
Simon Wang: How to, right.

79
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:39.250
Simon Wang: how to coordinate the bus routes, so you guys can check out, and maybe Talia can talk about this project a bit more.

80
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.360
Simon Wang: Right?

81
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:55.389
Simon Wang: And, yeah, so ultimately, we want to become agents of change, and we want to advocate for policy improvements.

82
00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:00.280
Simon Wang: That's going to be a long shot, because, you know.

83
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:15.140
Simon Wang: the government staff, as I mentioned earlier, they have their own way of doing things. They would have very little incentive to make changes unless we have very strong evidence, we have very strong case to make.

84
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.150
Simon Wang: So, but I think there's a real opportunity there, real possibility there.

85
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.180
Simon Wang: Term to do that.

86
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.610
Simon Wang: Okay? So that's kind of, the overview of, of this, this course.

87
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:34.100
Simon Wang: Before we move on, because we only got a few students, I just want to kind of quickly invite each of you to

88
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:47.279
Simon Wang: Talk a little bit about, what's your, impression, and, if you got a chance to work on a project here, what area, what policy area would you like to

89
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.500
Simon Wang: to, explore.

90
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.730
Simon Wang: Maybe, start from Kenshu.

91
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.519
Simon Wang: Any… any policy, anything you think the government can…

92
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.119
Simon Wang: Maybe the 650.

93
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.020
Simon Wang: 15.

94
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.200
Simon Wang: whichever.

95
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.710
Simon Wang: Which area?

96
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.260
Simon Wang: Safety.

97
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.619
Simon Wang: Oh, safety, you mean road safety?

98
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.079
Simon Wang: Or… file safety.

99
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.010
Simon Wang: Maybe we'll see.

100
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.780
Simon Wang: Road. Road safety. Okay, well, actually,

101
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:48.210
Simon Wang: That could be, one of the projects that we're going to explore, because if you look at Here…

102
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.790
Simon Wang: We have a couple of, group projects that you guys can…

103
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.360
Simon Wang: Can choose, and, road safety is one of them.

104
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.060
Simon Wang: So,

105
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:04.799
Simon Wang: you can take a look. I mean, these pages, we need to update, but as you can see.

106
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:12.189
Simon Wang: This is actually one of the projects. So, do you have anything specific in mind in terms of road safety? Have you done anything before?

107
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.470
Simon Wang: Okay.

108
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.480
Simon Wang: Thanks.

109
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.470
Simon Wang: How about you?

110
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.680
Simon Wang: And I want to do the project about Blueshot.

111
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:43.030
Simon Wang: Fish out this, like, just, public health issues, or some… I…

112
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:50.739
Simon Wang: I didn't have any other ideas, because it's out of this topic. Although it's a…

113
00:12:50.850 --> 00:13:02.620
Simon Wang: But, like, also is, public health issues. It's, like, hospital accessing… Cost or fees.

114
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.290
Simon Wang: Oh, increase. Increasing the fee, right? So you're increasing the fees, yes. Okay.

115
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.649
Simon Wang: So what would be the issue here? Do you think,

116
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.510
Simon Wang: Do you want to look at the impact of the increasing fee, or…

117
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:30.040
Simon Wang: In their… Hong Kong citizen perspective, And we are also… It's a real… we are… briefing.

118
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.470
Simon Wang: It is not that hard.

119
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:48.440
Simon Wang: not acceptable, because this free is very expensive for everyone. Okay. Yeah. So you think, you think, it's, it's too… too expensive?

120
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.610
Simon Wang: Alright, but what about people who have insurance?

121
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.590
Simon Wang: I think this policy will… Burden dirt.

122
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:13.750
Simon Wang: residents to access to cares. I mean, it's, problem-making issues.

123
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.380
Simon Wang: Okay, sure.

124
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:20.400
Simon Wang: Well, yeah, I think, you pick a good topic, because,

125
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:27.519
Simon Wang: this is kind of talk of the town now, right? The public hospitals increased the fees.

126
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.909
Simon Wang: How about you?

127
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.720
Simon Wang: You have something in mind?

128
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:37.830
Simon Wang: Yeah, well, I don't really know that much about Hong Kong policy,

129
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.369
Simon Wang: But I think transportation is interesting.

130
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.519
Simon Wang: Transportation? Yeah. Okay.

131
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:48.729
Simon Wang: So, from where you, you live, do you use public transportation that much?

132
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:53.390
Simon Wang: No, the… it's almost… it's all driving. Right. Yeah.

133
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:59.690
Simon Wang: Actually, it's very good here, I like it a lot, so… Public transportation. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

134
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.370
Simon Wang: Yeah, I… I think…

135
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:14.459
Simon Wang: I mean, if you are more familiar with some private cars, we can also look into that. For example, like, there's, like, electric vehicles, that could be something to look at.

136
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:29.000
Simon Wang: Because I think it really depends on the car size. When we have a small class size, I think we can afford to kind of supervise some projects, not necessarily from the things that we prepare.

137
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:39.669
Simon Wang: But when we have a large class size like last semester, we have to kind of work on something that's, already kind of, we have something in the mouth, all right? So we will see, okay?

138
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.909
Simon Wang: Alright,

139
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:58.340
Simon Wang: So, going back to… Here… If you go to Coast Home, go back to Coast Home.

140
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:07.349
Simon Wang: You can see that, we have, kind of the entire semester map out, starting from today.

141
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.989
Simon Wang: And we have a total of, 13 weeks.

142
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.550
Simon Wang: Okay, so…

143
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.850
Simon Wang: Today, we're just doing a course introduction, to kind of introduce a little bit of what we're trying to do.

144
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:33.469
Simon Wang: And then, next week, we will be doing some hands-on, activity on, vibe coding, so you need to bring a mobile computer back.

145
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:40.809
Simon Wang: Actually, tablet may not work, so it's better if you, get a, mobile computer.

146
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:47.210
Simon Wang: You know, this is the week that could be a little bit challenging, because

147
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:53.009
Simon Wang: Especially for students with very limited, programming, experience.

148
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.730
Simon Wang: Yet, we will try to make it more,

149
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.660
Simon Wang: Kind of supportive and friendly, especially if we don't have that many students.

150
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:09.010
Simon Wang: All right, so, so, the vibe coding would be an important part that we want to,

151
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.349
Simon Wang: Focus on?

152
00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.339
Simon Wang: And, you have to,

153
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:22.869
Simon Wang: install the VS Code, and there will be a Jupyter Notebook embedded in the VS Code, and you need to sign up for GitHub.

154
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:32.049
Simon Wang: a couple of things. So, week two will be much more hands-on, right? And also a little bit scary, a little bit intimidating.

155
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:38.900
Simon Wang: But, hopefully you will, appreciate the potential and power of, of, of that.

156
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.020
Simon Wang: Of, of the technologies.

157
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:52.469
Simon Wang: And then, by week 3, after the add-drop period, everybody will settle down, then we need to start, forming the groups and, select the topics.

158
00:17:52.730 --> 00:18:10.940
Simon Wang: All right? And in week three and week 4, there will be some in-class exercises that you need to work on, and actually, that would also count for something towards the final grades, and that's why it's important for people to come back and work on things.

159
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:20.699
Simon Wang: And again, this is… this is kind of… there's a little bit of, like, a learning curve here, right? So everybody have to try to figure out things a bit.

160
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:29.500
Simon Wang: All right? And this is also during these two weeks that we need to select the topics, and we need to start, writing email to the government.

161
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:40.430
Simon Wang: About our, topics. So we're going to start collecting some, preliminary information from the government staff regarding their decision-making process, regarding their data governance.

162
00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.089
Simon Wang: Okay, so that's, week 3 and 4.

163
00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:54.020
Simon Wang: And then starting from week 5 all the way to week 10, a total of 6 weeks, these are all going to be small group meetings.

164
00:18:54.150 --> 00:19:05.549
Simon Wang: Right, so, our course is, very, kind of personalized in the sense that, each team of students will be doing their own project. We'll have, two teachers helping you.

165
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.270
Simon Wang: And

166
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:27.119
Simon Wang: Each week, we'll have some agenda, we'll have some milestones, and students need to do something, before the meeting, and hopefully this will be the sort of very kind of personalized, project-based learning experience that you will find relevant and useful.

167
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:33.840
Simon Wang: Okay, and we'll also have a week assigned for students to do field work.

168
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.300
Simon Wang: So that means you need to go to the site and collect some data.

169
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:48.070
Simon Wang: Right, so that, that would be the kind of, bulk of this, this course, right? So the, the, the, the six-week.

170
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.190
Simon Wang: journey towards, accomplish…

171
00:19:52.360 --> 00:20:01.750
Simon Wang: something for this… for this course. And then, the last 3 weeks, week 11, we're going to do a presentation, kind of a first round, like a rehearsal.

172
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.759
Simon Wang: And then another,

173
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:18.120
Simon Wang: meeting to kind of wrap things up. And finally, there will be the final presentation, and hopefully we will get something ready for submission to the lawmakers.

174
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:34.569
Simon Wang: And, usually in week 13, we're going to invite some stakeholders, invite some community partners as audience. Last semester, we invited a senior correspondence from South China Morning Post, Natalie Wong, as our guest.

175
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.170
Simon Wang: So we haven't decided, who we're going to invite.

176
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:51.459
Simon Wang: And also, throughout the semester, we might also have some guest speakers to give talks, not necessarily during the class time. It could be online in the evening, just as part of the

177
00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:59.550
Simon Wang: So, that's kind of the general overview of…

178
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:11.430
Simon Wang: this course. And, based on the feedback from last semester, some students find the vibe coding part a bit challenging, some students feel that the course has too much work.

179
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:22.769
Simon Wang: We are trying to adjust it, you know, because, this is the second time we run this course, so hopefully everybody will have a good experience, taking this course.

180
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:32.199
Simon Wang: And also, we, kind of in the process of trying to recruit a few more students, even though,

181
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:45.640
Simon Wang: you know, I think the math department does not necessarily have a kind of a minimum requirement for the enrollment. I think it would be reasonable to expect at least 10 students to be enrolled in this course.

182
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:54.160
Simon Wang: But, that being said, you know, even we have fewer students, we should still be able to run this course, so hopefully we'll have students

183
00:21:54.250 --> 00:22:03.110
Simon Wang: joining this course, we have a kind of an optimal, class size. That would be, very, very good.

184
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:24.159
Simon Wang: Okay, so… so that's kind of the introduction. Now I want to, start covering some materials that we, prepared for week one, and there will be two parts, part one from me talking about data governance, and part two from, my colleague, Talev from the math department, and she will be talking about technology and math.

185
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.000
Simon Wang: So that's, that's, what we're gonna do.

186
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:39.180
Simon Wang: Okay, so in terms of data governance, our primary goal in this course is to critically review the data governance of the Hong Kong government.

187
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.289
Simon Wang: So, here are the key questions we want to answer.

188
00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.589
Simon Wang: The first question is, how does the Hong Kong government make decisions?

189
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.740
Simon Wang: And, to what extent are these decisions actually informed by data?

190
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.150
Simon Wang: And,

191
00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:08.760
Simon Wang: then how can citizens like us, ordinary people, right, engage constructively to improve data governance? When we use the word constructively, that means we are going to do things

192
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.730
Simon Wang: Kind of in a very rational and peaceful way.

193
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.629
Simon Wang: But then we also want to create pressure for the government.

194
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:32.320
Simon Wang: All right, so, throughout this course, you will work in teams to investigate the real policy issues in Hong Kong. Your journey will involve, first, to identify, to choose a policy area and identify specific government decisions.

195
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:46.279
Simon Wang: To investigate, to, look at, you know, how government is making decisions by requesting information from them, and… and then we apply the math modeling to, explore how data governance could be

196
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:52.599
Simon Wang: Improved. And finally, we're going to submit a report and a poster to the lawmakers.

197
00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.360
Simon Wang: Alright?

198
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.920
Simon Wang: So that's, that's kind of, what we're trying to do here.

199
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:08.360
Simon Wang: Now, I want to, Offer two case studies.

200
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.120
Simon Wang: No.

201
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.829
Simon Wang: If you're from Hong Kong, you should know what this is, right?

202
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.660
Simon Wang: Tianzu, do you use this?

203
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:30.709
Simon Wang: So this is an app, for, you know, one of the major bus companies in Hong Kong is called Colon Moto,

204
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.160
Simon Wang: bus company.

205
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:39.629
Simon Wang: Kim… Kim… C or something? Right, can be, right? Okay.

206
00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.350
Simon Wang: So, as you can see here.

207
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.870
Simon Wang: Because I live in this neighborhood called, St. Martin.

208
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.269
Simon Wang: But then on this app, there's two… station called Martin.

209
00:24:51.500 --> 00:25:01.409
Simon Wang: Even though it's the same names, but it's actually two bus stops, okay? One is on the side of where I live, the other… the other is across the street.

210
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:07.439
Simon Wang: And it's just a very little thing, but it's so annoying, because I got confused all the time.

211
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:08.789
Simon Wang: Is that me?

212
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:19.269
Simon Wang: Because I look at one bus stop, it says, oh, 5 minutes, the bus is 5 minutes away, I go down, but then actually it's the bus across the street, 5 minutes arriving, you see what I mean?

213
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.760
Simon Wang: See, this is actually a tiny problem, because it's also data governance.

214
00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:30.790
Simon Wang: You see what I mean? So, so it's like, how do you govern, how do you manage the data? So,

215
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.760
Simon Wang: It could offer better user experience, essentially.

216
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.619
Simon Wang: So I start writing complaint letters.

217
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:40.830
Simon Wang: Can you believe that?

218
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.900
Simon Wang: It took, like, 4 years.

219
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:51.700
Simon Wang: before this is actually, resolved. So I, I started, writing complaint letters back in 2021,

220
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:57.240
Simon Wang: You know, asking, hey, can we, change this? Hi.

221
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.789
Simon Wang: And we go back and forth, back and forth.

222
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.589
Simon Wang: you know, started from March 2021, 3 years later.

223
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:15.830
Simon Wang: I just can't get, make progress, so eventually I decided to write

224
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.710
Simon Wang: this email to the Assistant Director of the Transport Department.

225
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.270
Simon Wang: Okay?

226
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.490
Simon Wang: And then that'd take, like, another…

227
00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:34.030
Simon Wang: I don't know, a year or so, to eventually, Get to this point, You see?

228
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:41.540
Simon Wang: They got two… Bus stops names with the code.

229
00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.160
Simon Wang: Alright?

230
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.790
Simon Wang: So now we have a, kind of.

231
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:51.429
Simon Wang: Distinguished, or disambiguation of these two bus stops.

232
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.870
Simon Wang: Alright?

233
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.970
Simon Wang: Now, the point of this story

234
00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:06.460
Simon Wang: Is that if you find a problem related to data, related to public policy, or kind of public transportation in this case.

235
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:21.189
Simon Wang: there is a real possibility, a real chance to actually pressure the government to do something about it. And this time, of course, we pressure the government, and then the government asked the bus company to change the app.

236
00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:29.810
Simon Wang: So… I hope, you know, through this story, you can see that this is not entirely impossible.

237
00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.850
Simon Wang: Right? When you see something, there's, like, a room for improvement.

238
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.790
Simon Wang: If we do something about it, there's a chance that it can be improved.

239
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.209
Simon Wang: Alright, so that's kind of the take-home message.

240
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:52.179
Simon Wang: And, one little details you might want to know is that, there's this government telephone directory.

241
00:27:53.010 --> 00:28:02.159
Simon Wang: That, you can actually get the email address from all the the departments, Including the…

242
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.340
Simon Wang: Let me see… transport…

243
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:21.680
Simon Wang: So, if you go to the transport department, I think I emailed… Mr… Patrick Hull.

244
00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.400
Simon Wang: Alright, so I email, email him.

245
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:28.380
Simon Wang: See, most people don't know this site.

246
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.540
Simon Wang: Right?

247
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.319
Simon Wang: So, you won't be able to…

248
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.320
Simon Wang: Reach out to these people.

249
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:41.349
Simon Wang: Because if you just go to the Transport Department website, You only got this.

250
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.620
Simon Wang: And this email will go to 1823Team.

251
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.840
Simon Wang: Alright? But, if you know this website.

252
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:55.129
Simon Wang: you know, that piece of information, knowledge actually makes a world of difference. So this is what we call knowledge is power, right?

253
00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:01.599
Simon Wang: So, so, so just, just being able to find this email and start writing an email, that makes a world of difference.

254
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.250
Simon Wang: Okay.

255
00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:08.510
Simon Wang: So hopefully, hopefully that's, that's an inspirational story right there.

256
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.809
Simon Wang: Now… dumb… The next, kind of.

257
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.200
Simon Wang: a story I want to share.

258
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:23.630
Simon Wang: before I pass it over to my colleague, is, the influenza vaccination program.

259
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:32.050
Simon Wang: Now, I actually wrote, quite a number of letters to the editor in South China Post on this topic.

260
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:38.429
Simon Wang: And this is the one that… I think this is the first one I wrote, alright? So the policy issue…

261
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:44.030
Simon Wang: Is that, you know, the government actually runs a flu shot program for the elderly and for the schoolchildren.

262
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.549
Simon Wang: But then the participation rates remain low.

263
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:52.770
Simon Wang: Alright, so there are questions we have to answer, including what data does the government collect on vaccination coverage?

264
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:59.159
Simon Wang: How do they decide where to allocate the resources, and could better data governance improve participation rates?

265
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.380
Simon Wang: Right?

266
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.870
Simon Wang: So you can see, this is… this is a letter that, I published.

267
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.509
Simon Wang: Almost 10 years ago.

268
00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:15.690
Simon Wang: Right? So my argument is that, the program needs better marketing, and so on and so forth.

269
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.910
Simon Wang: And you guys can, can take a look.

270
00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:22.810
Simon Wang: Oh, the girl just arrived, maybe I show you a QR code.

271
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.509
Simon Wang: So you can access this page.

272
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.080
Simon Wang: Before we go any further.

273
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.719
Simon Wang: You only scan the QR code, yeah.

274
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:34.589
Simon Wang: What's your name?

275
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.100
Simon Wang: Kate?

276
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.920
Simon Wang: case.

277
00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.409
Simon Wang: What's your major?

278
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:43.920
Simon Wang: Oh, marketing, alright.

279
00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.330
Simon Wang: So we have two business schools.

280
00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.980
Simon Wang: Right. Two pieces, one med student, one biotech student.

281
00:30:53.190 --> 00:31:01.910
Simon Wang: Alright, now, if you, if you read this, you can see that,

282
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.420
Simon Wang: I did a little bit of data collection, Right? So I asked…

283
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:12.569
Simon Wang: The government, in terms of how many people

284
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:22.290
Simon Wang: are actually eligible. So, see, the thing is, this is the data that the government released to their Website.

285
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:31.960
Simon Wang: Right? So the number of vaccines administered under the government vaccination program and vaccination subsidy programs has increased.

286
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.040
Simon Wang: Alright?

287
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:39.490
Simon Wang: So… so this… this seems to be good news.

288
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:46.869
Simon Wang: But then the outcome is not very good. The outcome was that the total number of cases actually increased.

289
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.690
Simon Wang: So how come?

290
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:55.399
Simon Wang: The number of people who got shots increased, but then the cases also increased.

291
00:31:55.990 --> 00:32:00.100
Simon Wang: Well… That's because… we…

292
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:05.149
Simon Wang: What the government didn't tell us, but we have to write an email to ask is.

293
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.860
Simon Wang: There's 1.5 million Hong Kong residents eligible

294
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:15.380
Simon Wang: For the free vaccination program, and the 1.9 million eligible for the subsidies scheme.

295
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:26.939
Simon Wang: Alright? So… The actual participation rate is actually pretty low. It's only under 30%.

296
00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:35.489
Simon Wang: And unfortunately, this data is not publicly available. You have to write to the Department of Health in order to get these numbers.

297
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.540
Simon Wang: Okay.

298
00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:39.450
Simon Wang: And so on and so forth.

299
00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.070
Simon Wang: So, and you can also see we have, this…

300
00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.699
Simon Wang: flow here, right? So we got…

301
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:55.390
Simon Wang: The data, and and then we propose the solution and everything, so you can… you can look at this a little bit.

302
00:32:56.010 --> 00:33:08.430
Simon Wang: Alright, so… and hopefully, what we are going to do in this course will be more sophisticated than that, because this was done back in 2017, you know?

303
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.510
Simon Wang: at the time, I don't have the,

304
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.690
Simon Wang: you know, collaboration, I don't have a… co-teacher.

305
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:24.929
Simon Wang: you know, it's with math background, so I can only just ask some very simple questions. But now I think we can do things in a more sophisticated way.

306
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.590
Simon Wang: Alright, which, we can talk more if you guys are interested in…

307
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:44.699
Simon Wang: doing this. But as I said, this is a real, real problem, you see what I mean? You know, every year, we actually got some schoolchildren and elderly people, unfortunately, died from influenza.

308
00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:51.860
Simon Wang: So, if we can further increase the participation rate of this program.

309
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.259
Simon Wang: You know, it's going to make a real world of difference.

310
00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:04.070
Simon Wang: Okay, so I think that's… that's all I have to say for now.

311
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.789
Simon Wang: Shall we move on, or take a short break?

312
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.790
Simon Wang: Okay, let's take a 3-minute break.

313
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.440
Simon Wang: On the answer on…

314
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.709
Simon Wang: You can see the assessment here.

315
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.170
Simon Wang: scanner.

316
00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.640
Simon Wang: Scandin, you need, we have a sidebar.

317
00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:25.230
Simon Wang: Okay, so good morning, everyone. I'm Talia from the Department of Mathematics.

318
00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:33.439
Simon Wang: So, in week one, I will briefly introduce the math that will be covered in this course, and also the corresponding technologies.

319
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.889
Simon Wang: So the purpose of this sharing is to give you an idea of the scope of math tools.

320
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:48.989
Simon Wang: So overall, we will introduce two types of mathematical tools.

321
00:38:49.270 --> 00:39:00.779
Simon Wang: The first one is, optimization problem. So, and actually later you will see the second type of mathematical model will be, linear regression.

322
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:08.140
Simon Wang: So these two type of tool can help us to solve some, real-world problem.

323
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:16.089
Simon Wang: So, the tool, the purpose is to serve the research question, or the research topic you… you will, work on.

324
00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:22.239
Simon Wang: So let me briefly introduce the optimization type of problem first.

325
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.170
Simon Wang: So actually, we meet this optimization problem every day.

326
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:31.730
Simon Wang: To suppose you, you would like to go to somewhere that you haven't been there before.

327
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:45.459
Simon Wang: What you would do is, very likely to open the Google Map, and just type in the destination, and Google Map would generate an ideal, or several ideal options for you to go there.

328
00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.690
Simon Wang: And overall.

329
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:57.170
Simon Wang: It shows the, the so-called best option, which either takes the shortest time there, or the shortest distance.

330
00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:03.829
Simon Wang: So this is a typical optimization problem. You want to go somewhere, but…

331
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.870
Simon Wang: You want to minimize the traveling time.

332
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:10.199
Simon Wang: Or you want to minimize the overall traveling distance.

333
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:15.410
Simon Wang: That is a very commonly seen optimization problem.

334
00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:19.210
Simon Wang: And another one might be,

335
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:26.340
Simon Wang: As a student, you want to maximize your GPA, while at the same time, you want to minimize your study time.

336
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.810
Simon Wang: Maybe that is another, optimization problem.

337
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:49.880
Simon Wang: And in, public transportation, it is always try to, the purpose of, like, the overall public transportation system is try to, say, minimize the, short… minimize the queuing time for either the buses

338
00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.969
Simon Wang: And for the passengers.

339
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:57.069
Simon Wang: So The overall objective

340
00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:07.220
Simon Wang: Of this optimization in the, these systems is always to try to, set up an efficient, system operation.

341
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:18.460
Simon Wang: And… The way to, set up and to solve the optimization problems, in general, there are two ways.

342
00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:24.820
Simon Wang: So the first way, the traditional way, is, more, analytical.

343
00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:34.069
Simon Wang: So we usually write out our objective function, so we want to minimize the traveling distance.

344
00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.100
Simon Wang: And then we have certain constraints.

345
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.830
Simon Wang: And we just solved the, the system of equations.

346
00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:46.360
Simon Wang: To minimize or minimize our objective function.

347
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.370
Simon Wang: So that is the traditional way.

348
00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:56.410
Simon Wang: And another commonly used way is to, solve the optimization problem via simulation.

349
00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:02.139
Simon Wang: So I will, show you an example of the so-called simulation.

350
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.019
Simon Wang: And this is actually one of the previous work of, student.

351
00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:13.850
Simon Wang: a question… comes from this bus roads planning program.

352
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.329
Simon Wang: for a certain districts in Hong Kong.

353
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:31.980
Simon Wang: So actually, every year, the Department of Transportation will collect opinions from the bus companies to have a plan to adjust the bus frequencies for certain routes.

354
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:37.379
Simon Wang: And the reason is, here.

355
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:41.519
Simon Wang: So there are some criterias,

356
00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:48.420
Simon Wang: That the service of the bus need to be, need to be adjusted.

357
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.970
Simon Wang: For example, regarding the frequency.

358
00:42:53.500 --> 00:43:01.180
Simon Wang: So, under what circumstances the bus company would consider to, increase the frequency of buses?

359
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.420
Simon Wang: Well, actually, there are clear criteria.

360
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:14.580
Simon Wang: It says that if the… Occupancy rate of any bus route reaches 90% and 75%.

361
00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:23.300
Simon Wang: during any busiest half hour of the peak period. And during that one hour, respectively, Or…

362
00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:28.869
Simon Wang: Reaches 60% during the busiest one hour of the off-peak period.

363
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:36.230
Simon Wang: Then, the transportation department and the bus companies will consider increasing its service frequency.

364
00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:41.930
Simon Wang: So there's very clear criteria, when to adjust

365
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:46.199
Simon Wang: Or in this case, to, increase the bus frequency.

366
00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:51.420
Simon Wang: So that, overall, the passenger experience can be improved.

367
00:43:52.970 --> 00:44:04.570
Simon Wang: And… One of the students find that in North District, The city bus wrote, Number 56.

368
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:09.490
Simon Wang: The frequency and also the road, were adjusted.

369
00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:18.409
Simon Wang: So… That must be based on the, the…

370
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:38.000
Simon Wang: So it must be the case that the overall seat utilization of the buses reached the criteria, so that they decided to increase the bus frequency.

371
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:46.650
Simon Wang: So he wanted to know, under the existing setting, so after the adjustment.

372
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:52.429
Simon Wang: Whether the seat utilization on this bus is actually improved.

373
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.650
Simon Wang: In other words, lower than the criteria.

374
00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.779
Simon Wang: before the adjustment.

375
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:08.369
Simon Wang: So he set up such, simulation. So you can see this is the bus route number 56 bus simulation.

376
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.179
Simon Wang: And there are two… Directions for this bus.

377
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:17.360
Simon Wang: One is inbound from Timmun to Shaan Shou.

378
00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:21.609
Simon Wang: This is the outbound, the other direction.

379
00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:27.259
Simon Wang: So, these dots just represent different bus stops.

380
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:31.839
Simon Wang: And here you can see there are some percentages.

381
00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:35.030
Simon Wang: Which represent the seat utilization rate.

382
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.520
Simon Wang: So it is basically the number of passengers on the bus

383
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:42.800
Simon Wang: Divided by the total number of seats on the bus.

384
00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:50.930
Simon Wang: So if the bus is full, everyone is sitting on their seats, then this percentage will be 100%.

385
00:45:52.950 --> 00:46:01.429
Simon Wang: Also, you can see a lambda here, so that represents the average arrival rate in that bus stop.

386
00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:09.170
Simon Wang: For example, this 0.5 means that, on average, In one minute.

387
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.259
Simon Wang: 0.5 passenger will arrive at that bus stop.

388
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.139
Simon Wang: So then…

389
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:25.969
Simon Wang: For 10 minutes in this time interval, for 10 minutes, then on average, 5 passengers will arrive at this bus stop to wait for this bus.

390
00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:33.959
Simon Wang: And also, there is a small queue, represents the number of passengers queuing at this bus stop.

391
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:41.790
Simon Wang: So now, this current clock time is 9 o'clock in the morning.

392
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:44.579
Simon Wang: And then I can just start simulation.

393
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.349
Simon Wang: Then the clock will start ticking.

394
00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:53.420
Simon Wang: And some numbers changes here, because people are, queuing.

395
00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:03.389
Simon Wang: Then the first bus departure at 910, so you can see this moving green box represents a bus.

396
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:10.949
Simon Wang: So the number represents the number of passengers on this bus, And correspondingly, the,

397
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:16.299
Simon Wang: Seat utilization can be calculated in a real-time, real-time way.

398
00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:25.970
Simon Wang: So, the bus moves fast between these stops, whereas it moves low

399
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:36.430
Simon Wang: Slowly here, because the distance between the two stops here is actually, way long than the bus stops.

400
00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.710
Simon Wang: For example, these two.

401
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:47.730
Simon Wang: So by doing this, so this is kind of simulation to simulate the real world.

402
00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.019
Simon Wang: And the data will be automatically recorded.

403
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:53.520
Simon Wang: And…

404
00:47:53.730 --> 00:48:01.629
Simon Wang: We can run this kind of simulation for a lot of times, say 100 times, just in a few minutes.

405
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:10.390
Simon Wang: So we don't have to really, collect the data, for every journey of the bus in every morning.

406
00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.840
Simon Wang: And we can also capture some randomness in this process as well.

407
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:25.269
Simon Wang: Because we know the passenger flow, and actually also the bus traveling will not be exactly the same every day.

408
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:27.350
Simon Wang: So…

409
00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:41.430
Simon Wang: Imagine that if you have morning classes, you may get up earlier and take bus at an earlier time period, whereas if you do not have earlier class, you may choose to, like, come to the campus in the afternoon.

410
00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.830
Simon Wang: So overall, the passenger flow will not be exactly the same every day.

411
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:51.570
Simon Wang: And the simulation can also capture this kind of randomness.

412
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.660
Simon Wang: And by running this a lot of times,

413
00:48:55.950 --> 00:49:08.939
Simon Wang: Considering this kind of randomness, we can have an overall estimate of, on average, what are the, say, the bus… the seat utilization rate for all these stops.

414
00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.349
Simon Wang: During a period of time.

415
00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.209
Simon Wang: Then, we can check.

416
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:18.650
Simon Wang: whether this… Seat utilization rate.

417
00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:24.549
Simon Wang: It's really decreased after the adjustment of this buzz frequency.

418
00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:33.040
Simon Wang: So if it's really decreased, then it justified the decision to increase the frequency of the bus.

419
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:38.680
Simon Wang: So this is an example of

420
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.589
Simon Wang: Yeah, that is a good question.

421
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:14.529
Simon Wang: So, although you may argue that, well, this is, like, artificial thing, it's not real, but the key parameters in this simulation are from the real-world, data.

422
00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:21.480
Simon Wang: So, for example, how do I know at this bus stop, on average, in one minute, 0.5 passengers will come?

423
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:34.950
Simon Wang: Well, this depends on the field work. So that student really went to, went to take this bus several times to record the number of people, queuing at each bus stop.

424
00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:37.929
Simon Wang: For several times, so that he can give

425
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.230
Simon Wang: A relatively realistic estimate of the parameter.

426
00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:50.749
Simon Wang: Like, so this parameter is about the passenger flow, right? How many people, will wait at that bus stop?

427
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:59.370
Simon Wang: And actually, you can observe that for this lambda, for some stops, this number is big, like 0.5,

428
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.890
Simon Wang: Whereas for some other stops, like only 0.15,

429
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:12.410
Simon Wang: So that means these stops with smaller lambda value, there are less people waiting there.

430
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:17.990
Simon Wang: During morning, this morning, time period.

431
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:25.839
Simon Wang: And for some stops, like this MTR station, usually the lambda will be larger.

432
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.930
Simon Wang: So this is an MTR station, and many people will wait there.

433
00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:37.910
Simon Wang: to get on the bus to maybe go back home. So that's… just looking at this,

434
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.719
Simon Wang: Parameters, you can see, it is reasonable.

435
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:47.690
Simon Wang: It is not… it is not like all the bus stops have the same amount of passengers.

436
00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:13.600
Simon Wang: I think he just took this bus, and when bus arrived at a specific stop, he counts the number of people get on the bus.

437
00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:16.429
Simon Wang: So that will be the number of…

438
00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.570
Simon Wang: That will be the number of people who chewed there.

439
00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.980
Simon Wang: Before they get on the bus.

440
00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:31.930
Simon Wang: Okay, so, so we have some real,

441
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:40.600
Simon Wang: data from the site, right? From the fieldwork that can help us to build a model. But then, can we still,

442
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:53.899
Simon Wang: validate the results a little bit, and we'll get back… get to him very soon. Is there any way we can validate the result, or can we just show this to lawmakers or policy makers and ask them to use this

443
00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:55.470
Simon Wang: for decision making.

444
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:08.619
Simon Wang: I think for this simulation, it is more like a, reflect of reality. It is not a real hypothetical situation, because this is…

445
00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:21.169
Simon Wang: this basically records what… what is happening. It is not like a… we plan to have an adjustment, and we, we need to have certain

446
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:25.029
Simon Wang: hypothetical assumption were that this is a…

447
00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:29.519
Simon Wang: I think a mirror of the reality. So I think for that…

448
00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.220
Simon Wang: for this case, I think,

449
00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:39.189
Simon Wang: I think it is reliable, because for the key parameters, they are really…

450
00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:46.600
Simon Wang: estimated based on the reality. Okay. Yeah, and as long as the model can capture the key…

451
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:51.730
Simon Wang: The key variables, the key… Mmm…

452
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:57.309
Simon Wang: how to say, the key factor to the problem, then I think it's good enough.

453
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:06.500
Simon Wang: Yeah, one thing that confuses me is, like, let's say… The lambda is 0.

454
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:10.969
Simon Wang: Yeah, because… So, will it never, like…

455
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:21.580
Simon Wang: Like, in the simulation, there will never be a passenger, so it's like… There's no, like, the…

456
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:40.320
Simon Wang: the station… whatever the stop is, is kind of, like, not… Useless. Useless, yeah. Yeah, the reason that there are certain stops, having this lambda equals to zero is that based on the observation from the students, based on the limited time of field work of the student.

457
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:46.410
Simon Wang: He really did not observe any passengers get on the bus on those stop… at that… at those stops.

458
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:52.230
Simon Wang: Okay, and then, did he, like, record a… A standard deviation?

459
00:54:52.810 --> 00:55:00.119
Simon Wang: I think in the original data, in the Excel, he recorded all the data there is.

460
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:08.310
Simon Wang: But I believe for those equals to zero, there's no standard deviation, zero. Yeah. Yeah.

461
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:13.440
Simon Wang: Yeah, I think, with a team, I think it's,

462
00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:22.799
Simon Wang: better than individual work, because at that time, this is actually his, dissertation, so he worked this independently, and

463
00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:38.349
Simon Wang: he only has limited time, so he can only took the bus maybe twice or three times at most, but I think with a team, there will be more chance for the students to observe the same thing more times, so that more data can be collected.

464
00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:46.790
Simon Wang: I think this case may also point to the possibility of the government

465
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.660
Simon Wang: To collect data more systematically.

466
00:55:49.680 --> 00:56:03.040
Simon Wang: Right? Because, obviously, if we only just, you know, take the bus a couple of times to collect the data, that's a kind of a very small set of data, even though it can be useful. But what if, you know, just imagine a world

467
00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:10.299
Simon Wang: In which, like, the bus company can collect the octopus card, readers.

468
00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:27.890
Simon Wang: Because most people use Octopus cards these days to, you know, tap the card and get on the bus, and I would assume that the data would come with time, right? And even the location. So, presumably, we should be able to have a real data set

469
00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:32.220
Simon Wang: With, you know, how many passengers would get on bus in each stop.

470
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:37.790
Simon Wang: on a given period of time, you know, this data should be available. It's probably…

471
00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:57.709
Simon Wang: held by the bus company. Now, the question would become, you know, if we have such data, would that help us to make better decisions when it comes to frequency adjustment of the buses? And if so, then should we make a case for the government to actually collect the data from the bus companies?

472
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.689
Simon Wang: You see what I mean? So, what do you think? Do you think that that might be something we could explore as well?

473
00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:09.170
Simon Wang: Yeah, I think if the Octopus data

474
00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:25.659
Simon Wang: would be available, then students don't have to really collect the data by themselves. If the data is already available, that would be much more convenient. But I think the work is still valuable, because we are trying to use this work

475
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:34.809
Simon Wang: To illustrate or to make the argument that we should, or the government should collect the data from the bus company.

476
00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:43.150
Simon Wang: Which I think is not entirely, you know, wishful thinking, because back during the pandemic.

477
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:49.040
Simon Wang: the University of Hong Kong team actually got Octopus data to try to track the…

478
00:57:49.250 --> 00:58:02.249
Simon Wang: I couldn't remember exactly what they do, but they got some Octopus data to track the pandemic or something. The transmission of the virus? Yeah, yeah, it's on the news, so we can check it out, yeah.

479
00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.260
Simon Wang: Okay.

480
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:13.009
Simon Wang: So this is one of the examples to show, to use simulation to solve the optimization problem.

481
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:26.500
Simon Wang: Okay, so you can see that simulation can be used to model some, complex systems. So, especially this system is quite,

482
00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:30.569
Simon Wang: Dynamic is not a static, system.

483
00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:37.989
Simon Wang: And it can also be used to explore some hypothetical situations and answer the what-if scenarios.

484
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:52.250
Simon Wang: So even, we know that we want to increase the frequency of bus so that the overall seat utilization rate can be lower down, then how much should we increase the frequency?

485
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:55.819
Simon Wang: This is also a problem, right?

486
00:58:56.220 --> 00:59:00.669
Simon Wang: So suppose, originally, there are only two buses in 1 hour.

487
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:03.400
Simon Wang: So the headway is 30 minutes.

488
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:12.720
Simon Wang: Then, whether we should, like, make the headway become 25 minutes, Or 20 minutes, Or 15 minutes.

489
00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:16.480
Simon Wang: So which one is the best solution?

490
00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:23.280
Simon Wang: To serve the, passengers, to make the… Seat utilization rate lower down.

491
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:28.539
Simon Wang: But at the same time, we also need to consider about the cost of the bus company.

492
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:34.289
Simon Wang: Because with more buses, say, in one hour, if there are 4 buses.

493
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.650
Simon Wang: Then the bus company needs to hire two more drivers.

494
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:41.430
Simon Wang: Compared to the two buses per hour scenario.

495
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:45.739
Simon Wang: And not mention about the funeral, the other cost.

496
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.029
Simon Wang: So then, at which point is, is the win-win solution?

497
00:59:51.340 --> 01:00:02.630
Simon Wang: That the passengers can be, can have better experience, because they don't have to stand on a bus, they can sit, and at the same time, the bus company can also have, their profit.

498
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:08.580
Simon Wang: So if we want to have a, like, quantified

499
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:13.419
Simon Wang: Solution, then simulation can, can help us.

500
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:19.269
Simon Wang: It can test the new solutions in a cheaper and safer manner.

501
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:28.790
Simon Wang: So we don't have to really implement our new plan immediately and collect data. We can just test the new, potential plan

502
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:34.090
Simon Wang: On the computer, and then have an estimation, then

503
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:39.710
Simon Wang: If we find that a specific plan works the best, then we can maybe implement it.

504
01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:57.250
Simon Wang: So this kind of simulation can actually be implemented using the simulation module in Python, which is called SynPy.

505
01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:10.079
Simon Wang: So later in, I think, maybe week four, we will, use examples to show you how to implement this kind of simulation, using this Python module.

506
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:25.500
Simon Wang: And recall that overall, we only cover two type of mathematical models. The first one is optimization, using simulation.

507
01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:34.819
Simon Wang: And the second way is actually a statistical model, which is called linear regression, and some variations of linear regression.

508
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:42.800
Simon Wang: So this… Linear regression, the aim is to do certain interpretation of data.

509
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:49.449
Simon Wang: So I think, may I ask how many of you have heard about this linear regression before? Do you mind raising your hand?

510
01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.389
Simon Wang: Okay, okay.

511
01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.470
Simon Wang: That's great.

512
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:59.309
Simon Wang: So overall, we use linear regression to answer the questions like this.

513
01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:05.979
Simon Wang: So, for example, how population density impacts the demand for public services.

514
01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.620
Simon Wang: So whether there's a certain relationship between the two.

515
01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:15.779
Simon Wang: And if there is an association, then whether this association is positive or negative.

516
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:20.130
Simon Wang: And if it is positive, then what the effect size is.

517
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:25.250
Simon Wang: And by answering these type of question.

518
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:37.489
Simon Wang: the answer can be used to inform the public resource allocation and also the development of sustainable cities. So we can see, we should… if we find that there's positive relationship between the two.

519
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:46.620
Simon Wang: Then maybe we could consider to allocate more public services or resources to those areas with a higher population density.

520
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.570
Simon Wang: And also,

521
01:02:50.840 --> 01:03:00.499
Simon Wang: Regression can help us to answer what are the relationships among certain public opinion, political trust, and public satisfaction.

522
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:11.109
Simon Wang: So this can be used to assess the government performance and the legitimacy of certain public policies.

523
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:24.440
Simon Wang: If you scan this QR code, you will find a questionnaire that, was performed by a previous student. It is about the, garbage bag charging scheme.

524
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:33.440
Simon Wang: So that is part of the policies of the, municipal solid waste management.

525
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:43.380
Simon Wang: But unfortunately, this policy, is… Basically permanently suspended.

526
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:49.859
Simon Wang: So the government will not consider to charge for the, garbage bag in the short term.

527
01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:58.499
Simon Wang: But overall, the purpose of that survey through this questionnaire is.

528
01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:04.730
Simon Wang: The students want to know what factors influence the public support for this policy.

529
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:09.959
Simon Wang: So, she designed, several sections.

530
01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.919
Simon Wang: Maybe it's better for me to…

531
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.730
Simon Wang: Simon, do you know how to…

532
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.930
Simon Wang: I mean, how can I scan this QR code?

533
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:35.770
Simon Wang: Okay, then may I invite you to scan it, you, sir?

534
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.290
Simon Wang: Mobile phone.

535
01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.160
Simon Wang: Oh.

536
01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:45.970
Simon Wang: What's green.

537
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:52.530
Simon Wang: I think it's bilingual.

538
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:54.470
Simon Wang: Questionnaire.

539
01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:57.910
Simon Wang: Oh.

540
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:02.470
Simon Wang: Yo.

541
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.140
Simon Wang: So there's certain description of this survey.

542
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:14.670
Simon Wang: It says this survey aims to understand Hong Kong residents' awareness, attitudes, and daily waste management behaviors

543
01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.199
Simon Wang: Related to the waste charging policy.

544
01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:23.240
Simon Wang: So I think… The core, research question

545
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:30.749
Simon Wang: That, hopefully, to be answered using this questionnaire is, what factors would influence people's

546
01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:38.380
Simon Wang: Perceived level of support, where this garbage bag charging scheme.

547
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:48.149
Simon Wang: So whether it's, like, people who have a higher education level, they are more likely to support this policy.

548
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:54.029
Simon Wang: Or, if people already have their recycling behavior.

549
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:58.560
Simon Wang: Those people are more likely to support this new policy.

550
01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:03.160
Simon Wang: Or whether the elderlies, or females.

551
01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:08.170
Simon Wang: Whether these groups of people are more likely to support this new policy.

552
01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:15.090
Simon Wang: Or, if people think that this policy will be helpful for the overall recycling rate of Hong Kong.

553
01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.229
Simon Wang: They perceived that This policy is helpful.

554
01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.080
Simon Wang: or effective.

555
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:34.359
Simon Wang: For the problem solving, like increasing the recycling rate, or decrease the overall amount of waste, then this group of people are more likely to support this policy.

556
01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:43.790
Simon Wang: So overall, this linear regression model can help us to, explore the relationship among these variables.

557
01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:52.759
Simon Wang: And if I remember correctly, the conclusion for her, research question is.

558
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:57.019
Simon Wang: Overall, the perceived level of fairness

559
01:06:57.190 --> 01:07:02.539
Simon Wang: Of the policy is the most important factor that influenced the level of support.

560
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:09.100
Simon Wang: So if the, if the resident believes that this policy is fair.

561
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.569
Simon Wang: Then they're more likely to support this policy.

562
01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:24.509
Simon Wang: And specifically in this course, the level of support to this policy is called the dependent variable.

563
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:33.490
Simon Wang: And we want to know what kind of factors, or what kind of one or more independent variables, like some demographic factors mentioned.

564
01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:48.309
Simon Wang: or the recycling behavior, or the knowledge about recycling. Those can be regarded as independent variables, and we want to know how these variables are, correlated.

565
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:54.539
Simon Wang: And the model is built, or called fitted, based on data.

566
01:07:54.780 --> 01:08:04.890
Simon Wang: And later in our course, we will see how we can use the, another commonly used Python library, which is called scikit-learn, to fit a model.

567
01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:10.430
Simon Wang: So that we can, study the exact relationship among these variables.

568
01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.000
Simon Wang: Okay, so…

569
01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:22.819
Simon Wang: No matter if it is an optimization problem or a regression type of problem, we want to do some

570
01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:24.380
Simon Wang: interpretation.

571
01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:27.740
Simon Wang: We cannot do them by hand.

572
01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:32.280
Simon Wang: If we cannot solve the, dynamic

573
01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:38.519
Simon Wang: Like, public transportation problem, or to find the,

574
01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.669
Simon Wang: To fit the line using our hands.

575
01:08:42.529 --> 01:08:46.930
Simon Wang: So finally, we will use computer to use Python to help us.

576
01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:49.270
Simon Wang: To implement those models.

577
01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.460
Simon Wang: And…

578
01:08:51.569 --> 01:09:02.069
Simon Wang: I understand that this is a GE course, so we, as Simon has already mentioned, we do not expect students have prior programming experience.

579
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:05.269
Simon Wang: Because nowadays we have generative AI.

580
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.599
Simon Wang: We can ask its help to generate code, to help us implement the models.

581
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:20.199
Simon Wang: So overall, I think, no matter it is about math models, or it's about vibe coding.

582
01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.820
Simon Wang: All these two, they serve your

583
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:26.609
Simon Wang: Research topic, or a research question.

584
01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:31.990
Simon Wang: So research question and research topic is the most important.

585
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.580
Simon Wang: And a math model will be just a tool.

586
01:09:35.830 --> 01:09:37.939
Simon Wang: To study your research question.

587
01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:46.369
Simon Wang: Whereas to implement those models, we need, vibecoding or generative AI to help us to implement the models.

588
01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:50.540
Simon Wang: So that's the overall, logic.

589
01:09:52.040 --> 01:10:02.729
Simon Wang: And for those who have not used the, so-called vibe coding before, here is a very short video clip to show you, how, how it works.

590
01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.679
Simon Wang: Now that we have… Sorry.

591
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:08.869
Simon Wang: Let me…

592
01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:18.780
Simon Wang: So later, this engineer will show, how this GitHub co-pilot works.

593
01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:23.429
Simon Wang: So suppose that we have already had this co-pilot installed.

594
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:29.759
Simon Wang: Maybe let me make the… Speed is lower.

595
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:54.430
Simon Wang: So basically here, it defines a function.

596
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.319
Simon Wang: And as long as you put the name of the function.

597
01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:03.239
Simon Wang: It guests what you want to write, and generates this ghost text.

598
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:07.929
Simon Wang: Basically, this is, should be correct.

599
01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:16.119
Simon Wang: And if you click tab, those ghost tests will become cold, and you can try to run it and see whether it works.

600
01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:14.980
Simon Wang: Yeah, I think we can stop here. So the purpose is to sell GitHub Copilot.

601
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:25.120
Simon Wang: And we are working on GitHub Copilot, not other Copilot in Microsoft. Okay, so make it clear, it's GitHub Copilot.

602
01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:30.070
Simon Wang: We will talk more about it, In the next weeks.

603
01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:31.640
Simon Wang: next week.

604
01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:50.699
Simon Wang: Okay, and actually there is a newly published textbook. So this textbook is published, I think, around 1 years ago. It is called your Learn AI-Assisted Python Programming with GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.

605
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:55.330
Simon Wang: So later I will share the, software ins…

606
01:14:55.950 --> 01:15:13.220
Simon Wang: installation chapter, on Moodle, so, if you have not installed, like, VS Code, or if you have not applied for the education benefit of GitHub, you may follow the instruction to, to, set up things.

607
01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.199
Simon Wang: And I think the,

608
01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:26.289
Simon Wang: the GitHub Copilot, dramatically changed how people learn to program.

609
01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.449
Simon Wang: So in the past, in the past years, I mean, maybe 3 years ago.

610
01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.909
Simon Wang: The programmer spend a lot of time on the syntax and structure of problem?

611
01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:51.659
Simon Wang: And if you look at the recruitment advertisement for programmers, very likely, it is for a specific program language. Say we want someone who can write Java, or with someone who can write Python.

612
01:15:52.110 --> 01:16:03.440
Simon Wang: Because learning to program in languages take a lot of times, and usually those syntax are quite different for different programming languages.

613
01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:13.889
Simon Wang: But nowadays, actually, with the help of GitHub Copilot, it can generate basic programs almost immediately, and almost always correct.

614
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:23.259
Simon Wang: And what we need to do is just to describe the program we want in words, like what you saw in the video clip.

615
01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:36.150
Simon Wang: I want the program to consider this, to change to that, to be able to adapt to multiple email address, then GitHub Copilot will generate the updated code for you.

616
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:42.179
Simon Wang: And the way it works is that when we type a prompt.

617
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:48.920
Simon Wang: The GitHub Copilot will send our prompt to the large language model, on the internet.

618
01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:55.479
Simon Wang: And then OpenAI's GPT, LLM, interpret our prompt, and then generate code.

619
01:16:56.890 --> 01:16:59.799
Simon Wang: That's overall how, this worked.

620
01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.140
Simon Wang: How this works?

621
01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:17.100
Simon Wang: But, in this way, what… then do we need to, like, ignore everything, and, do we… do we still need to, read some small programs, or do we still need to learn programming?

622
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:25.389
Simon Wang: Well, I think, for the basic programming part, it is not that, important.

623
01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:34.299
Simon Wang: But still, we need to have or develop the skill to break down a large problem into some smaller tasks.

624
01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:37.140
Simon Wang: that can be handled by GitHub Copilot.

625
01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.730
Simon Wang: So recall that we have that, public transportation optimization problem.

626
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:53.369
Simon Wang: So, I really don't expect that if I just use one or two sentences to describe, hey, give me a simulation of this bus.

627
01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:00.369
Simon Wang: I won't believe the result will be good, because this task is too big, too vague.

628
01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:07.810
Simon Wang: And there are many detailed assumptions behind this very, general one-sentence.

629
01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:14.059
Simon Wang: So I have to break down this very big simulation problem into some pieces.

630
01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.839
Simon Wang: So that GitHub co-pilot can handle those pieces one by one.

631
01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:22.449
Simon Wang: And then, later, I can put them together so that,

632
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:26.200
Simon Wang: So that, that, big, program.

633
01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.690
Simon Wang: does exactly what I want to do.

634
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:39.620
Simon Wang: Another example is that I cannot… I cannot tell the GitHub compiler, like, hey, write me a video game. Write me a game.

635
01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:46.810
Simon Wang: That is also quite vague, right? There's no specific instructions, so…

636
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:50.729
Simon Wang: We need to, develop the skill to be able to break down

637
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:54.729
Simon Wang: The very big problem into smaller pieces.

638
01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:02.990
Simon Wang: And also, it is important to, to learn how to communicate with GitHub Copilot.

639
01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:08.350
Simon Wang: That… there is a name for it, it's called Prompt Engineering.

640
01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:11.870
Simon Wang: And I suppose, you have heard

641
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:17.039
Simon Wang: some of the tricks already, like giving a role to the AI,

642
01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:21.349
Simon Wang: Setting the role and, give more context information.

643
01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.530
Simon Wang: And also, be explicit about the requirement.

644
01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:30.840
Simon Wang: So, I think that also needs certain, practice.

645
01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:35.449
Simon Wang: So that's the, copilot understand what we want.

646
01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:45.609
Simon Wang: Okay, I think that will be all of the, content related to math and the, technology.

647
01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:52.040
Simon Wang: So overall, they serve, again, they serve your research question.

648
01:19:52.500 --> 01:20:00.840
Simon Wang: The research question is the most important. And if it turns out that the research topic you will work on,

649
01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:08.140
Simon Wang: cannot be… studied using either optimization or regression, then…

650
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:16.800
Simon Wang: we can find more appropriate tools to work on the research question. So these tools are just S…

651
01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:20.579
Simon Wang: They, they serve your research question, okay?

652
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:25.890
Simon Wang: Do you have any questions about… this.

653
01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:43.179
Simon Wang: Alright, so, any, any questions? Thanks, Talia. So, I think,

654
01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:53.700
Simon Wang: That's… that's pretty much what we plan to cover today, you know, this, week one is still the agile period, so we're not going to kind of overwhelm you.

655
01:20:53.900 --> 01:21:01.669
Simon Wang: But, I do encourage you to start looking at, the… some of the good projects that we,

656
01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:03.040
Simon Wang: Heavy mind.

657
01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:14.489
Simon Wang: As I said, if we got a small class size, we actually can afford some time and efforts to supervise, your own project.

658
01:21:14.890 --> 01:21:22.219
Simon Wang: As long as this is something related to the public policy and the Hong Kong government in particular.

659
01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:30.580
Simon Wang: And, you know, that policy decision has been made and can be discussed and evaluated in the context of data governance

660
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:37.240
Simon Wang: We can apply some mass models, then it's, it's game, you know, we can, we can do it.

661
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:43.810
Simon Wang: But, of course, I would encourage you to look into some of the projects here as well.

662
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:50.299
Simon Wang: Right, so… You guys have, any other thoughts?

663
01:21:50.770 --> 01:21:57.230
Simon Wang: Something you want to, ask before we, kind of… End the discussion here.

664
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:05.410
Simon Wang: Oh, I think some of you asked about assessment earlier.

665
01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:09.460
Simon Wang: Maybe I can just quickly, go through this.

666
01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:16.299
Simon Wang: Starting from week 3 and week 4, we will have some in-class exercise.

667
01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:21.079
Simon Wang: And, you know, that would be, like, just 10%.

668
01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:28.080
Simon Wang: And then, in around week 5, 7, and 9, there will be 3 reflective essays that you have to write.

669
01:22:28.230 --> 01:22:35.159
Simon Wang: So, all this… so, together would be 30%, so this 30% would be individually assessed.

670
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:41.259
Simon Wang: And then the, the presentation, there will be two presentations.

671
01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:54.589
Simon Wang: That would be a total of 25%, and that's group project, so it will be assessed based on the whole group's presentation. Well, we do take into consideration the specific

672
01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:58.460
Simon Wang: students, both animals as well.

673
01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:05.719
Simon Wang: So that would be a total of, you know, 50%.

674
01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:12.609
Simon Wang: And then there's just the final report and poster, which will be 30%, and

675
01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.140
Simon Wang: there's the human AI collaboration report, 20%, so…

676
01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.530
Simon Wang: In terms of breakdown, that's how it works.

677
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:23.459
Simon Wang: I think we'll still kind of, update this.

678
01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:26.450
Simon Wang: But, I…

679
01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:33.210
Simon Wang: Based on our experience last semester, we're going to adjust things a bit. Hopefully, we're going to provide more scaffolding and support.

680
01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:42.419
Simon Wang: Throughout the semester, instead of, you know, towards the end of the semester, you know, everybody would rush to get things done.

681
01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:50.879
Simon Wang: And also, in this course, we embrace AI. We, offer different ways that you can use AI.

682
01:23:51.000 --> 01:24:01.500
Simon Wang: unlike some of the other courses that you may have to take, you know, here, you know, some teachers are kind of a bit more skeptical about AI and plagiarism.

683
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:20.840
Simon Wang: well, we do take care… we do take it seriously. We… we're going to respect all university honor codes, but we believe that, human-AI partnership is the… is the future, right? So… so that's why we're going to, help you to benefit and leverage the technology as much as possible.
