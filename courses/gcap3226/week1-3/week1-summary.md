# GCAP3226 Week 1 — Summary

## Key points

### Course identity
- **Title:** Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong — empowering citizens through data.
- **Goal:** Participate as ordinary citizens in policy discussion, influence government behaviour and decision-making, and push for more transparent, data-informed policy.
- **Teaching team:** Dr. Talia Wu (Math, coordinator), Simon Wang (Language Centre) — combination of quantitative and qualitative reasoning. No strong math background required; general education course.

### Four course objectives
1. **Analytical tools** — Vibe coding: use AI/LLMs to write and run code without deep syntax knowledge; AI can help fix errors. Tools will support problem-solving in the course and beyond.
2. **Government transparency and accountability** — Examine how government makes decisions and to what extent decisions are data-informed. Use the **Code on Access to Information**: write to government staff; they must respond within **three weeks**. Request information to understand decision-making and data availability.
3. **Experiential learning** — Apply skills to real-world problems: fieldwork, primary data collection. Aim for real impact (e.g. reports to Legislative Council, engagement with lawmakers and stakeholders).
4. **Agents of change** — Advocate for policy improvements with evidence. Government may have little incentive to change without strong evidence and clear cases.

### Data governance (Simon)
- **Key questions:** How does the Hong Kong government make decisions? To what extent are decisions informed by data? How can citizens engage constructively to improve data governance (rationally, peacefully, but also creating pressure)?
- **Student journey:** Choose a policy area and specific government decisions → request information from government → apply math/modeling to explore how data governance could be improved → submit report and poster to lawmakers.
- **Case 1 — Bus stop naming (Tianzu / KMB app):** Two stops both named “St. Martin” caused confusion. After years of complaint letters (from 2021), email to Assistant Director of Transport Department (via **government telephone directory** for staff emails) led to disambiguation (e.g. names with codes). Lesson: finding the right contact and persisting can lead to change.
- **Case 2 — Influenza vaccination:** Low participation despite government programme; data on eligible population (e.g. 1.5M / 1.9M) and participation rates not fully public — obtained by writing to Department of Health. Example of using data requests to assess and improve programmes; real impact (e.g. reducing flu-related harm).

### Math and technology (Talia)
- **Two types of tools:** (1) **Optimization** — e.g. shortest time/distance (Google Maps), maximising GPA, minimising bus queuing; (2) **Linear regression** — to be introduced later. Tools serve your research topic.
- **Ways to solve optimization:** Traditional (objective function + constraints, solve equations) and **simulation**.

### Course roadmap (13 weeks)
- **Week 1:** Introduction (done).
- **Week 2:** Hands-on vibe coding — bring laptop; install VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, sign up for GitHub. Can be challenging but support available.
- **Weeks 3–4:** After add-drop — form groups, select topics; in-class exercises (count toward grades); start writing to government for preliminary information.
- **Weeks 5–10:** Small group meetings (personalised, project-based), milestones each week; one week for fieldwork (site visit, data collection).
- **Weeks 11–13:** Rehearsal presentation → wrap-up meeting → final presentation; aim to submit to lawmakers; Week 13 — invite stakeholders/community partners (e.g. guest like Natalie Wong, SCMP).

### Other
- Projects aligned with SDGs. Example areas: flu vaccination, bus routes, road safety, hospital fees, transportation. Past work: flu shots evaluation, bus route coordination. Course homepage has QR code and course roadmap; feedback from last run led to adjustments (vibe coding difficulty, workload).

## Actionable insights

1. **Before Week 2:** Install VS Code, set up Jupyter, sign up for GitHub; bring a laptop (tablet may not be sufficient).
2. **Use the Code on Access to Information:** When investigating a policy, plan to write to the relevant department; use the **government telephone directory** to find staff emails (not only generic 1823).
3. **Choose a policy area early:** Think about topics (e.g. road safety, flu shots, hospital fees, transport) and be ready to form groups and select topics in Weeks 3–4.
4. **Combine data + outreach:** Use both data requests and analytical/math tools to build a clear case for policy improvement.
5. **Learn vibe coding with “Ask” first:** Use AI in a way that helps you learn (e.g. Ask mode) before relying on full automation (Agent mode).
