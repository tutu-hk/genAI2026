# GCAP3226 Week 3 — Summary

## Note on source

The **week3GCAP3226.vtt** transcript content matches Week 2 (hands-on vibe coding, VS Code, GitHub, data visualization). Week 3 in the **course roadmap** (from Week 1) is defined as: after add-drop, **form groups**, **select topics**, **in-class exercises** (count toward grades), and **start writing to government** for preliminary information on your policy area. This summary combines (1) what the roadmap assigns to Week 3 and (2) any recurring technical points from the transcript that remain relevant in Week 3.

## Key points (from course design)

### Week 3 focus (per roadmap)
- **Group formation** — finalise teams for the semester project.
- **Topic selection** — choose policy area and specific government decisions to investigate.
- **In-class exercises** — activities that count toward final grades; attendance and participation matter.
- **First outreach to government** — start writing (e.g. email) to relevant departments to request information on decision-making and data (Code on Access to Information; 3-week response window).

### Technical continuity
- If Week 2 setup is not fully done (VS Code, GitHub, Jupyter, Python, CSV + notebook), complete it so you can use vibe coding for data work and for any Week 3–4 tasks that involve data or code.
- Keep using **Ask mode** to learn; use **Agent mode** when you need faster automation.

### Link to Week 4
- Weeks 3 and 4 together: select topics, do in-class exercises, and begin systematic information requests to government. Use the **government telephone directory** to find staff emails where appropriate (not only generic hotlines).

## Actionable insights

1. **Form your group early in Week 3** and agree on a policy area (e.g. road safety, flu vaccination, hospital fees, transport) so you can start outreach in Weeks 3–4.
2. **Draft your first information request** to a relevant department; state clearly what decision or data you are asking about and cite the Code on Access to Information if useful.
3. **Catch up on tools** if needed: ensure VS Code, GitHub, and Python are set up and that you can run a Jupyter notebook and generate at least one simple visualization from a CSV.
4. **Attend and participate in in-class exercises** — they contribute to your grade.
5. **Align topic with SDGs and course themes** (data governance, transparency, evidence-based policy) so your project fits the course objectives and assessment.
