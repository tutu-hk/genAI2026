- Total: 11 cells (markdown + code)
- Topics covered:
  - Random variable generation with NumPy
  - Normal distribution visualization (histogram, box plot)
  - 4-step SimPy structure
  - Simple bus trip simulation (Stop A → Stop B)
  - 100 simulation runs with random travel times
- Key concepts: random seeds, statistical distributions, generator functions, `yield`, `env.now`

#### B. `Exercise_2_student.ipynb`
- Total: 6 cells (instructions + code)
- Three tasks:
  1. Generate Poisson random numbers (λ=5, seed=48, n=20)
  2. Modify bus simulation to include boarding time
  3. Visualize arrival time distribution
- Assessment focus: Understanding random variables and simulation modification

**Technical Notes:**
- Both notebooks use: numpy, simpy, matplotlib

---

### 4. PowerPoint Conversion
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Challenge:** No direct PowerPoint tools available in environment

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Installed `python-pptx` library via pip
2. Created custom Python script: `convert_ppt.py`
3. Script features:
   - Extracts text from all slides
   - Maintains slide structure
   - Formats as markdown with headers
   - Handles bullet points
   - Preserves slide numbering

**Conversion Results:**
- Input: `Case Study II_ Evaluating the Efficiency of Bus Route Adjustments_ City bus No. 56.pptx`
- Output: `Case Study II_ Evaluating the Efficiency of Bus Route Adjustments_ City bus No. 56.md`
- Total slides processed: 22
- All text content successfully extracted

---

### 5. Case Study Content Analysis
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Source:** Converted markdown from slides

**Key Content Discovered:**

#### Policy Problem:
- Bus Route 56 had only 32% passenger load factor
- Government increased frequency and adjusted route
- Contradicts stated criteria (60-90% load factor required)

#### Simulation Methodology:
- **Data Collection:** 30 trips via https://data.gov.hk/en/ API
- **Random Components (3 types):**
  1. Travel time: Normal distribution (mean/SD from data)
  2. Waiting passengers: Poisson distribution
  3. Alighting passengers: Binomial distribution
- **Scale:** 1,000 simulations per scenario
- **Framework:** SimPy discrete-event simulation

#### Results:
- **After adjustment:** 12-34% (forward), 5-34% (return) seat utilization
- **Before adjustment:** 18-56% (forward), 8-58% (return) seat utilization
- **Conclusion:** Adjustment REDUCED utilization

#### Advocacy Component:
- Prepared formal enquiries to Transport Department
- Requested operational data, methodology, and data access
- Example of evidence-based policy challenge

**Significance:**
This demonstrates the exact type of analysis students will perform in their group projects - using data and simulation to question government decisions.
