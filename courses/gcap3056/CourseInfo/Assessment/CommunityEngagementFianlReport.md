consider the Moodle posts I used in Fall 2025
courses/gcap3056/CourseInfo/Assessment/ReportPortfolio.html
courses/gcap3056/CourseInfo/Assessment/submissionTemplate.html

prepare a new CommunityPortfolioReportGuide.md (following courses/gcap3056/CourseInfo/Assessment/AIresponseGuideline.md)
in the new md file we need to set up a timeline for completing the task by week 10
we'll provide a template and expect AI to help

we don't need to make the announcement this week (week 4; we can let students know a bit later )
but we need a timeline so they can get it done by week 10

we can have a tentative plan and revise and finalize it by Feb 12 (week 5)

in the md file raise a few questions for further discussion
