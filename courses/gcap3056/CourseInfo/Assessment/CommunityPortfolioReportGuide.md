- **AI use:** Allowed; keep prompts and edits; at least two human revision rounds; declare in submission.

## 3. Extra Credit (Optional)

- After submitting the report and portfolio, you may **further develop the work** for extra credit:
  - Turn it into a **LegCo report** and submit to the Legislative Council.
  - **Reach out to the media** (e.g. SCMP or other outlets) to gain visibility.
- LegCo submission is **not required** for the core assessment; it is **extra credit** only.

## 4. Other Arrangements

- **Presentation to stakeholder:** May be arranged (details to be announced).

---

## 5. How AI Can Help

- Use AI to draft sections, improve clarity, and check structure against the template.
- Always fact-check and revise; final voice and responsibility remain with the team.

## 6. Questions for Further Discussion (if needed)

1. **Stakeholder presentation:** When and how will the optional presentation to stakeholder be arranged (e.g. week, format, sign-up)?
2. **Moodle setup:** Should the guide link to the dedicated Moodle forum/post once it is created?
