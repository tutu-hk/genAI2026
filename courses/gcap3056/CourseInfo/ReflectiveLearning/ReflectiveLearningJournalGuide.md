# Reflective Learning Journal — Guide (New Semester)

## Purpose

Clarify the requirement for the reflective learning journal so you can plan and submit with confidence.

---

## Weighting and assessment

- **35%** of your final grade.
- **Individually assessed** (your own journal, not group).
- Aligns with course outcomes (CILOs 3 & 4): value principles in public discourse, and applying knowledge by writing as informed citizen-scholars.

---

## What we are looking for

- **Learning as lasting change** in behaviours and attitudes, not one-off tasks.
- **“Wow” moments**: when something in the course surprised or impressed you.
- **“Aha” moments**: when you saw how to use course ideas in your project or practice.
- **Depth of reflection** and **breadth of contribution** to the Moodle discussion board (where drafts are shared).

---

## Format and length

- **Required**: at least **3** journal entries (Entries 1–3).
- **Optional**: up to **2** more entries (Entries 4–5) — we encourage 5 in total, but the last two are optional.
- **Minimum per entry**: about 150 words.
- **No upper word limit**; write as much as helps you reflect clearly.
- You may use **writing, voice-recording and/or filming** (multimodal) where it supports reflection.

---

## AI use and human oversight

- You are **encouraged to use AI to draft** journal entries.
- Drafts must be **reviewed and refined by you** (human oversight).
- Your **partnership with AI** should be one of the **central themes** in the reflective account (as in the course syllabus).

## Submission schedule (early submissions encouraged)

To help you build the habit and avoid a last-minute rush, we suggest submitting entries in stages:

| Entry   | Suggested by   | Required? |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Entry 1 | **Week 6**     | Yes       |
| Entry 2 | **Week 7**     | Yes       |
| Entry 3 | **Week 8**     | Yes       |
| Entry 4 | **Week 9**     | Optional  |
| Entry 5 | **Week 10**    | Optional  |

- You can submit earlier than the suggested week; the “by” dates are the latest we expect that entry.
- **Final deadline (tentative)**: **Week 10** — all entries (including any optional ones) should be in by then. Confirm the exact date on Moodle.
- Use your Moodle replies and weekly tasks to **select and curate** your entries, with AI assistance as you prefer.

---

## Process and deadline

- **By around Week 9**: You will have a collection of your Moodle replies from the weekly tasks.
- Staged submissions (see table above) let you spread the work and reflect while the course is in progress.

---

## Submission

- Submit your journal entries in the place indicated on Moodle (e.g. “Please reply here to submit your journal entries”).
- Drafts can be shared in the Moodle discussion board for peer learning before you finalise.
