this is the instruction from last semester 

this semester we try to do it a bit differently 

we have the general philosophy about learning 
learning as the permanent change in behaviors and mindset (attitudes) 
so we are looking for such changes 

we are looking for the moments of Wow and Aha 
Wow: when you are amazed or impressed by sth in the course 
Aha: when you figure out a way to apply sth amazing to your project 

we do some tasks every week; the tasks may help you find the Wow and Aha moments 
in around week 9 each student will get a collection of your replies to Moodle performing different tasks 



so let's set the deadline as week 10 (tentatively); all tasks will be completed by week 9 
then students can curate their reflective learning journals with AI assistance
