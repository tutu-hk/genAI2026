# Reflective Learning — process log

## 2025-02-05

- Created `reflectLearning.html` for Moodle based on `setup.md`.
- Content: reminder for students to access GitHub repo and Google Docs notes; all links encapsulated in `<a href="...">`.
- Created `process.log` in `courses/gcap3056/CourseInfo/ReflectiveLearning`.
- Next: commit and push to remote GitHub.

## 2025-02-06 (or later)

- Added `SyncGoogleDoc.md` instructions: fetch Google Doc tab → `GoogleDocsMoreInfo.md`.
- Created `GoogleDocsMoreInfo.md` with link to the doc tab; automatic fetch not possible (Google Docs requires auth / JS). Placeholder and instructions for pasting tab content added.
- Updated `process.log`.
