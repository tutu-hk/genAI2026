# Search plan: how AI may perform web searches for the project

- **Purpose:** Explore how AI can support teams to curate publicly available information for the course project (government programme, decisions, stakeholders) and to document both **process** and **results** for review (Task 4.1) and for use in the Community Engagement Portfolio & Report.

---

## 1. Role of web search in the project

- **Project workflow** (see `Approach.md`): identify programme → curate public info → formulate hypotheses → raise questions → send under Code on Access to Information → use replies.
- **Week 4 focus** (see `week4Look4focus.md`): find issues to focus on; hypotheses are the bridge between info found and questions for government; AI can perform search tasks and help formulate hypotheses and questions.
- **Assessment:** Portfolio & Report need evidence from public sources (government, media, SCMP); reflective journal can reflect on partnership with AI in searching and curating.

---

## 2. What to search for (scope)

- Background on the **government programme** and **specific decisions** chosen by the team.
- **Stakeholders** and **consequences** (who is affected, how).
- **Official sources:** gov.hk, bureau/department sites, LegCo, press releases.
- **Public discourse:** SCMP, other media, civil society, to see what is already debated and what remains unclear.
- **Code on Access to Information:** how to make a request, timelines (21–49 days), which department/Access to Information Officer; useful when drafting and sending questions.

---

## 3. How AI can perform the search (process)

- **Queries:** Formulate clear queries (programme name, policy area, department, key terms). Use site-specific search when possible (e.g. `site:gov.hk`, `site:legco.gov.hk`, `site:scmp.com`).
- **Steps to document (for Task 4.1 and reproducibility):**
  1. Query or prompt used.
  2. Sources returned (URLs, titles).
  3. Short summary of each relevant result.
  4. What is still missing or unclear (gaps → candidates for questions to government).
- **Output:** A short report or table: process (queries, steps) + results (links + summaries). Teams then critically review: what is more useful, what is less relevant, how could the search process be improved.

---

## 4. Link to tasks and assessment

- **Task 4.1:** Critically review web search results from AI; review both **process** (how AI searched) and **results** (what was found); comment on usefulness and relevance and room for improvement.
- **Task 4.2:** Use the curated info and review to formulate hypotheses and raise questions for government staff; finalise questions.
- **Portfolio & Report:** Use curated public info (and, where relevant, AI search documentation) as evidence in the report and appendices (e.g. “Communicating with government”).
- **Reflective journal:** Can reflect on Wow/Aha moments from using AI for search and on human oversight (e.g. checking sources, judging relevance).

---

## 5. Example: documented process and results

**Example query (background for the project):** “Hong Kong Code on Access to Information government request”

**Process documented:** One search performed to find how to request information from the government (relevant to sending questions under the Code).

**Results (links and short summaries):**

- [Code on Access to Information (FAQ)](https://www.access.gov.hk/en/faq/index.html) — Official FAQ on the Code.
- [The Code (DSD)](https://dsd.gov.hk/EN/Code_on_Access_to_Information/The_Code/index.html) — DSD page on the Code.
- [How to Make Information Request](https://www.access.gov.hk/en/howtomakeinfo/index.html) — How to make a request (form, letter, email; cite the Code).
- [AccessInfoHongKong](https://www.accessinfo.hk/) — Civil society resource on access to information.
- [Procedures for Access to Information (CMAB)](https://cmab.gov.hk/en/access/procedures.htm) — Government procedures.

**Summary:** The Code applies to all government bureaux and departments and certain public bodies. Any person can request information; requests go to the Access to Information Officer of the relevant department (form, letter, or email citing the Code). Departments may refuse under specified exemptions (e.g. defence, law enforcement). Response times (e.g. 21–49 days) are set out in the procedures; fewer, focused questions can help avoid long delays.

**Gaps / follow-up:** Exact response timeframes and escalation paths can be confirmed from the official “How to Make” and “Procedures” pages when drafting questions; teams may also search for their specific department’s Access to Information Officer.
