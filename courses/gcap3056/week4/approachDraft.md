the course intends to critically review a government program (not a general policy)
the basic assumption is that the government staff should have done a better job
there is room for improvement
this would involves some value judgment which is related to value principles

so what are value principles?
these are the principles or things which the community would agree on despite the lack of consensus on how to achieve specific goals
for example, we may not agree on whether we should implement a charging scheme on solid waste; but most people would agree that we should protect the environment and promote sustainable lifestyle

so going back to the course project

we need to identify a government programme and focus on some specific decisions made by the government staff
these decisions may carry consequences and affect certain stakeholders
we need to know more about the programme and the decisions through curating publicly available info
then we need to raise questions - which the public info cannot answer
then we send these questions to the government staff for their answers under the Code on Access to Information 

according to the original plan (course schedule) we are supposed to prepare some questions for the government staff to answer

now we are in week 4; we should raise these questions; we should try to send them off before Chinese New Year

then we'll have to wait for 21 calendar days (sometimes up to 49 days- how to avoid 49 days- ask fewer questions)

then the answers may shed new light on the program and help us confirm or reject some hypotheses

for week 4

we need to curate some public info 

but we can get help from AI agent 

I am going to demonstrate how web pages can be found on a given topic with a summary 

then how we can identify some issues to pursue further 

we need to form some hypothese and raise some questions for the government staff 

we also need to anticipate the answers and plan the next steps; what could be our recommendations; at this stage, without a reply from the government 

while we pursue the project, we need to consider how to write a letter to the editor in SCMP which is an important avenue to express our views (as an abridged version of the Legco report)
