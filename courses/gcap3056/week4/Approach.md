# Overall approach: how to pursue a project in the course

- The course **critically reviews a government programme** (not a general policy).
- **Assumption:** government staff could have done better; there is room for improvement.
- This involves **value judgment** linked to **value principles**.

## Value principles

- Principles or goals the community can agree on even without consensus on *how* to achieve them.
- *Example:* disagreement on a solid-waste charging scheme vs. broad agreement on protecting the environment and promoting sustainable lifestyles.

## How to pursue the project

- **Identify** a government programme and focus on **specific decisions** by government staff.
- Those decisions have **consequences** and affect **stakeholders**.
- **Curate** publicly available information to understand the programme and decisions (e.g. with AI support for finding and summarising sources).
- **Formulate hypotheses** about possible improvements; these link what you find to the questions you will ask.
- **Raise questions** that public info cannot answer.
- **Send questions** to government staff under the **Code on Access to Information** (replies typically 21–49 calendar days).
- **Use replies** to confirm or reject hypotheses and plan next steps and **recommendations**.
- In parallel, consider **letter to the editor** (e.g. SCMP) as an abridged way to express views (and optional LegCo report for extra credit).

## Link to assessment

- **Tasks and rubrics:** see `courses/gcap3056/CourseInfo/Assessment`.
- **Community Engagement Portfolio & Report** (by Week 10): argumentative report + three appendices (writing for the public; communicating with government; engaging media/community); AI allowed with prompts/edits and at least two human revision rounds.
- **Reflective Learning Journal** (35%): at least 3 entries (e.g. by Weeks 6–8); Wow/Aha moments; partnership with AI as a theme; human oversight.
