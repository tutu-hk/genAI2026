Let's share the three files in Moodle as an html file

so we have a summary of what we did

then there are two tasks for students to work on

Moodle link:

Task 3.1 - practice Google site specific search

Task 3.2 - curate publicly available info

we updated the instructions and clarify the deadlines

also connect the two tasks to reflective learning journals

then we will have task 4.1 to review the search results by agent

now we need to clarify our workflow and approaches

so the agenda items for week 4

first remind students to work on task 3.1 and task 3.2 

then we assign  **task 4.1** which is to critically review the web search results from AI - we'll ask AI to document the whole processes of searching as well as results

team members should review the results and comment on them 

- what results are more useful; what are less relevant
- is there room for improvement regarding the AI search processes

the next step is to formulate some hypotheses and based on the hypothese to raise questions for the government staff 


then **task 4.2**  is to review the hypothese and questions for the government and finalise the questions for the government staff
