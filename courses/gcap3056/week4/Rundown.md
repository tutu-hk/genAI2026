# Week 4 rundown

- **Plan:** First showcase web search processes and results; then formulate hypotheses and raise tentative questions for the government staff. We cover each of the course projects in turn.

---

## 1. Recap and shared summary

- **Recap** what was covered in the past 3 weeks:
  - `genAI2026/courses/gcap3056/week1/Report.md`
  - `genAI2026/courses/gcap3056/week2/Report.md`
  - `genAI2026/courses/gcap3056/week3/transcriptLecture/summaryInsight.md`
- **Share** the three files in Moodle as an HTML file so everyone has a summary of what we did.

---

## 2. Remind students: Tasks 3.1 and 3.2

- **Moodle:** Task 3.1 (practice Google site-specific search), Task 3.2 (curate publicly available info).
- Instructions and deadlines have been updated; both tasks are connected to reflective learning journals.

---

## 3. Projects we will cover (all five/six)

We will go through each project so that every team gets focused input:

| # | Project | Brief focus |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **LegCo data access** | Healthcare policy analysis for rare diseases; LegCo data and media. |
| 2 | **Fire service 1** | Fire service incidents, emergency response, lessons from past fires. |
| 3 | **Government Vacancies app** | HK Government Vacancies mobile app; features, UX, improvements for job seekers. |
| 4 | **Fire service 2** | Fire service policies, operations, public safety (open-ended). |
| 5 | **Prevent sexual harassment** | Awareness, education, legal frameworks, support for victims. |
| 6 | **Rare disease healthcare support** | Drug access, treatment costs, policy challenges (incl. SMA). |

*(Adjust if your cohort has five projects; ensure each project is listed and covered.)*

## 4. Task 4.1 — Review AI web search results

- **Assign Task 4.1:** Critically review the web search results from AI.
- Require AI to **document the whole process** (queries, steps) as well as **results** (links, summaries).
- **Students:** Review and comment:
  - Which results are more useful; which are less relevant.
  - Is there room for improvement in the AI search process?
- **Reference:** `courses/gcap3056/week4/searchPlan.md` (how AI may perform web searches; process + results; link to Assessment).

---

## 5. Task 4.2 — Hypotheses and questions for government

- **Next step:** Formulate hypotheses and, based on them, raise questions for the government staff.
- **Task 4.2:** Review hypotheses and questions and **finalise** the questions to send to government staff (e.g. under the Code on Access to Information; aim to send before Chinese New Year if possible).

---

## 6. Task 4.3 — AI agent: what it is capable of

- **Goal:** Ensure students understand what an **AI agent** is capable of (and what its limits are).
- **Points to cover:**
  - **AI agent vs chatbot:** An agent uses an LLM plus **tools** (e.g. read URLs, create files/folders, run searches); a chatbot mainly returns text.
  - **Capabilities:** Multi-step tasks; following instructions in a file; visiting links and summarising; documenting process and results; structuring information (e.g. one folder per project).
  - **Use in the project:** Can support web search, curation, and drafting — but output must be **verified** by humans (errors, hallucinations).
  - **Why it matters:** Using an AI agent in an IDE (e.g. Cursor, VS Code) can make information-gathering and structuring much faster; critical to check and refine output before using it in submissions or government requests.
- **Reference:** Week 3 Session 3 (AI Agent and IDE) in `week3/transcriptLecture/summaryInsight.md`; optional GitHub/VS Code/Codespaces for those who want to try.

## 7. Workflow and approach

- **Clarify workflow and approach** using `courses/gcap3056/week4/Approach.md` (how to pursue a project in the course) and `courses/gcap3056/CourseInfo/Assessment` (tasks and rubrics, portfolio & report, reflective journal).

---

## 8. Agenda order (summary)

1. Recap; share Week 1–3 summary (HTML on Moodle).
2. Remind: Task 3.1, Task 3.2 (deadlines, link to journals).
3. **Task 4.1:** Review AI search process and results (showcase search first).
4. **Task 4.3:** AI agent — what it is capable of (and limits).
5. **Task 4.2:** Formulate hypotheses and tentative questions; finalise questions for government staff.
6. Go through **each project** in the list above for focused discussion.
