# Week 4: Look for focus

In week 3 teams have started locating docs from public sources and review the info to explore what issues to focus on
as a rule of thumb, we critically review the decisions made by the HK government and make suggestions on how to improve based on research findings and arguments
we need to find some issues to focus on and then formulate hypothesis about possible improvement
such hypotheses may require certain evidence or info to support or prove; if such evidence is absent, we cannot support the hypotheses
so the hypotheses are the bridge between info we find and questions we will raise for the government; they may also search for more info online in light of the hypotheses

we need to consider what tasks to assign to students in week 4 to create Wow and Aha moments 

I think AI can perform some search tasks for the students 

then with teacher input, AI can also help formulate hypotheses and raise questions 

then students need to meet and discuss and finalise questions for the government staff 

we can then start preparing for community engagement portfolio and report 

also think about letters to the editor
