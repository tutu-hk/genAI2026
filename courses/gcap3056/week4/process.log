# Process log — courses/gcap3056/week4

**Purpose:** Document what is being done in week 4 preparation, including chat history and all changes made to the codebase.

**Date:** 4 Feb 2026 (Wednesday)

## 1. Chat history summary

### Session 1 (earlier)

- **User:** Referenced `courses/gcap3056/week4/revise.md`.
- **Action:** Read `revise.md` (three tasks: Approach, searchPlan, Rundown; all following `AIresponseGuideline.md`). Read guideline, `approachDraft.md`, `planRundownDraft.md`, Assessment folder, week4 folder, `week4Look4focus.md`, `CommunityPortfolioReportGuide.md`, `ReflectiveLearningJournalGuide.md`.
- **Deliverable 1:** Created `Approach.md` from `approachDraft.md`, describing overall course approach and linking to Assessment.
- **User:** Approach OK but move “week 4 focus” to rundown; Approach should focus on how to pursue a project. Revise Approach.md and do Task 2.
- **Action:** Revised `Approach.md` (removed “Week 4 focus” section; retitled to “how to pursue a project”; removed week-4-specific bullet from assessment link). Created `searchPlan.md` (how AI may perform web searches; process + results; link to Task 4.1 and Assessment; example with Code on Access to Information search and links/summaries).

### Session 2 (this session)

- **User:** Go ahead. In Rundown also list all 5 projects (we’ll cover each). Add task 4.3 about AI agent (ensure students understand what AI agent is capable of). Create `process.log` in `courses/gcap3056/week4` to document everything (including earlier chat) and track all changes made to the codebase today.
- **Action:** Created `Rundown.md` from `planRundownDraft.md` with: week 4 plan (showcase search then hypotheses/questions); list of projects (all six group projects from repo, table); Task 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 (AI agent — capabilities and limits); recap, tasks 3.1/3.2, workflow. Created this `process.log`.

## 2. Changes to the codebase today (4 Feb 2026)

| Time / order | Path | Change |
|--------------|------|--------|

| 2 | `courses/gcap3056/week4/Approach.md` | **Revised.** Removed “Week 4 focus” section; renamed “Project workflow” to “How to pursue the project”; folded hypotheses, letter to editor, Code on Access into that section; removed “Week 4 tasks” from assessment link. Focus: how to pursue a project only. |
| 3 | `courses/gcap3056/week4/searchPlan.md` | **Created.** Search plan: role of web search; scope (programme, decisions, stakeholders, gov.hk, LegCo, media, Code); how AI can search and what to document; link to Task 4.1/4.2 and assessment; example (Code on Access to Information query with process + results + links/summaries). |
| 4 | `courses/gcap3056/week4/Rundown.md` | **Created.** Week 4 rundown: recap and shared summary; remind Task 3.1/3.2; list of all projects (6: LegCo data, Fire 1, Gov app, Fire 2, Sexual harassment, Rare disease); Task 4.1 (review AI search); Task 4.2 (hypotheses and questions); Task 4.3 (AI agent — what it is capable of); workflow; agenda order. |
| 5 | `courses/gcap3056/week4/process.log` | **Created.** This file. Documents chat history and all codebase changes above. |
| 6 | `courses/gcap3056/group1-legco-data-access/planNextSteps.md` | **Created.** Plan for next steps (workflow, AI vs human, references) towards group6-like progress. |
| 7 | `courses/gcap3056/group2-fire-service-1/planNextSteps.md` | **Created.** Same structure, tailored to Fire Service 1. |
| 8 | `courses/gcap3056/group3-government-app/planNextSteps.md` | **Created.** Same structure, tailored to Government Vacancies App. |
| 9 | `courses/gcap3056/group4-fire-service-2/planNextSteps.md` | **Created.** Same structure, tailored to Fire Service 2. |
| 10 | `courses/gcap3056/group5-prevent-sexual-harassment/planNextSteps.md` | **Created.** Same structure, tailored to Prevent Sexual Harassment. |
| 11 | `courses/gcap3056/groupX eHealth/planNextSteps.md` | **Created.** Same structure, tailored to eHealth (insurance reimbursement, SCMP letters, Simon Wang). |

### Later session (planforAllgroups)

- **User:** Referenced `courses/gcap3056/week4/planforAllgroups.md`.
- **Content:** More work done for group6-rare-disease (see process.log and files); progress in other teams varies; create a planNextSteps.md for each project in each project folder to describe workflow towards similar progress as group6; cover when to get help from AI and for what, what human input is essential, how human and AI work together; update week4 process.log.
- **Action:** Created `planNextSteps.md` in each project folder: group1-legco-data-access, group2-fire-service-1, group3-government-app, group4-fire-service-2, group5-prevent-sexual-harassment, groupX eHealth. Each plan includes: current state (what that group has), target progress (7-step workflow: curate → focus → search plan → AI web search + report → hypotheses → questions for government → process log), when to get AI help, what human input is essential, how human and AI work together, references to group6 and week4. Updated this process.log.
