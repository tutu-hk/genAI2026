**Sources:** Week 1 transcript (`week1.vtt`), [Week 1 page](https://gcap3056.hkbu.tech/spring-2026/weeks/1), course syllabus (`GCAP3056_Course_Syllabus.txt`).  
**Purpose:** Summarise Week 1 and give actionable steps for students.

## 1. What Week 1 Covered

### 1.1 What the course is about

- **Title:** *Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations.*
- **Idea:** Bridge university research and public policy by critically reviewing HK government decisions and making evidence-based recommendations. The course assumes the government can do better and that there is room for improvement.
- **Main “weapon”:** The **Code on Access to Information** – you can write to the government, ask questions, and expect a reply in about **21 days** (see [access.gov.hk](https://www.access.gov.hk)).
- **Public voice:** Writing **letters to the editor** in the *South China Morning Post* (e.g. up to 3 co-authors per letter). The course has helped over 300 students publish nearly 140 letters; government bodies (e.g. Department of Justice, Hong Kong Observatory) sometimes reply. There is also scope to meet lawmakers and to use the column for public education (e.g. science, policy).

### 1.2 Two principles: accountability and transparency

- **Government as “necessary evil” (Thomas Paine):** Government takes our money (taxation), makes rules that limit freedom, and can use legitimate force. So we need to **hold it accountable** and demand **transparency** – transparency is a prerequisite for accountability.
- **Practical example (bus stop):** Overcrowded bus at a Saturday rush hour (construction workers finishing at 5pm). Instructor wrote to the **Transport Department** (framed as bus service quality) – no quick response. Then wrote to the **Police** (framed as **public safety**) – police attended the next Saturday and the situation improved. **Lesson:** (1) Prefer **written** contact (e.g. email); avoid phone calls so there is a record. (2) Use the **Government Telephone Directory** to find the right office/officer (e.g. regional level first, then escalate if needed). (3) **Reframing** the issue (e.g. from “service quality” to “public safety”) can get a different and faster response.

### 1.3 Logistics and tools

- **Course site:** Use the QR code or link from the WhatsApp group to reach the course page; scan to join the WhatsApp group if not already in it.
- **Login (Week 1 platform):** Last 4 digits of student ID + first letter of first name + first letter of last name → get a **platform ID**. **Action:** Copy the platform ID and send it to the instructor via **WhatsApp (private message)** with your full name and full student ID. Do not post the platform ID in the group (delete if already posted).
- **Week 1 tasks (on the course page under “Tools – Two principles that guide our work” → “Accountability and transparency”):** Answer **three questions** (at least 10 characters each):  
  1. If you could hold the government accountable in one area, what would it be and how? (Specific decision/practice to change, who is responsible, what you want them to do differently, plus an example.)  
  2. What question would you ask the government about that issue?  
  3. (As implied in the transcript) What information could you collect from the government about it?

### 1.4 Assessment (from class and syllabus)

- **Group work (~65%):** Argumentative research paper (can be adapted into reports to government, letters to the editor, social media, presentations); **25%** of total grade. **Community engagement portfolio** (evidence of requesting information, writing for the public, visual piece e.g. infographic/video, and account of GenAI use): **40%** of total grade. Group size usually 4–5 (may be smaller if enrolment is under 20).
- **Individual:** **Reflective learning journal**, **35%** – multimodal (writing/voice/video), with GenAI partnership as a central theme; drafts shared on Moodle for peer learning.
- **Deadlines:** Aim to finish main work by **Week 11**; specific deadlines to be confirmed on Moodle.
- **Support:** **$300** project subsidy per student.

### 1.5 Group project options (Week 1)

Six options were introduced (details on course page under **Resources → Group Projects**). After logging in, students can enter their first name, choose a topic, and briefly state why they are interested (to help form groups).

1. **Fire safety accountability** – e.g. whether the Fire Service learned from past incidents (e.g. Grenfell Tower; Tai Kok Tsui fire Nov 2025).  
2. **e-Health** – 10th anniversary; follow-up on existing work; good fit for health-related majors.  
3. **Public hospital charges and low-income families** – fee exemption/reduction.  
4. **Legislative Council data** – how LegCo can share data more transparently.  
5. **Government apps** – pick any HK government app and review it.  
6. **Other** – other current policy/events (e.g. Policy Address themes).

### 1.6 Tentative schedule (Weeks 2–10)

- **Week 2:** Research using **public information** (library-style); get to know the topic and sharpen focus.  
- **Week 3:** Finalise questions and **email the government** (reply expected in about 3 weeks).  
- **Weeks 4–5:** Start outlining/drafting report to LegCo; **writing letters to the editor**.  
- **Week 6:** **Government replies** – evaluate responses.  
- **Week 7:** Field trip to **Hong Kong Free Press** newsroom (TBC).  
- **Week 8:** **Visual communication** workshop.  
- **Weeks 9–10:** Consultation and **community outreach** (e.g. booth on campus).  
- **Week 11:** Wrap-up.

*(Schedule is tentative and may be adjusted.)*

## 2. Actionable Insights for Students

| Priority | Action | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **1** | **Join the course WhatsApp group** (QR/link on course page) and keep an eye on announcements. | Required for links, login, and coordination. |
| **2** | **Log in to the Week 1 page** (last 4 digits of student ID + name initials) and **send your platform ID + full name + full student ID** to the instructor via **private** WhatsApp. | So the instructor can link your identity to your platform ID and you can continue with later tasks. |
| **3** | **Complete the three Week 1 questions** under “Accountability and transparency” on the course page (at least 10 characters each). | Aligns with CILOs (critical analysis, research, rhetoric) and helps you and the instructor focus on real issues. |
| **4** | **Choose a group project** on the course page (Resources → Group Projects): add your first name, pick a topic, and write a short reason. | Helps form groups by Week 2–3 so you can start research and government requests on time. |
| **5** | **Bookmark [access.gov.hk](https://www.access.gov.hk)** and skim how to make a request. | You will use the Code on Access to Information in Week 3 and for your community engagement portfolio (evidence of requesting information). |
| **6** | **Use written channels (e.g. email)** when contacting government; avoid phone-only contact so you have a record. | Supports accountability and gives you evidence for your portfolio. |
| **7** | **Use the Government Telephone Directory** to find the right bureau/department and, if needed, the relevant officer (e.g. regional level first, then escalate). | Makes requests more effective and shows you understand how government is structured. |
| **8** | **Start a reflective learning journal** (text/voice/video) and note how you use GenAI. Share drafts on Moodle when the forum is set up. | The reflective journal is 35% and GenAI partnership is a required theme; starting early avoids a last-minute rush. |
| **9** | **Invite interested classmates** if you stay in the course. | Course has a minimum enrolment (e.g. 15); spreading the word helps the course run. |

## 3. How This Matches the Syllabus

- **CILO 1 (synthesise and analyse; policy recommendations):** Week 1’s focus on accountability, transparency, and “what would you ask the government?” directly supports this.  
- **CILO 2 (collaborate; multi-disciplinary research):** Group project choice and early group formation support collaboration and cross-disciplinary angles.  
- **CILO 3 (value principles; rhetorical strategies):** The Thomas Paine discussion and the bus-stop reframing (service quality vs public safety) illustrate how principles and framing matter.  
- **CILO 4 (write for the public):** Letters to the editor, reports to government, and community engagement are all previewed in Week 1 and reflected in the 40% community engagement portfolio and 25% argumentative paper.  
- **GenAI:** Syllabus requires documenting GenAI use in the community engagement portfolio and making it a central theme in the reflective journal; Week 1 sets the scene for using it in research and writing.
