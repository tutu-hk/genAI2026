00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.030
classroom: I record my lessons all the time, but then I don't even have the time to process the video recording.

2
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:20.259
classroom: Anyway, so if you want to access this page, please scan the QR code, or you can go to the WhatsApp group. I leave a URL there.

3
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.820
classroom: You know, usually I got my, you know, customized domain link, but somehow I haven't

4
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.320
classroom: managed to get that, so I'm using Lovable. But later I will turn this into a more professional

5
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.520
classroom: web page.

6
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.129
classroom: Alright, so, once you are on this page.

7
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.620
classroom: You should be able to then scan the QR code to join,

8
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.299
classroom: WhatsApp group, if you haven't done so.

9
00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:04.530
classroom: Because the thing is, based on my WhatsApp group, enrollment, I've got… 11 students, so…

10
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.599
classroom: So, we just have to, kind of, have to see.

11
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:25.140
classroom: All right, so let's very quickly talk about this, answer this basic question. I'm sure that this is the question that everybody would have in mind. What is this course about, right? And,

12
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:37.320
classroom: If you look at the title, Taking a Stand, Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations, taking a stand is kind of a… implies that we're pretty contentious.

13
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.309
classroom: You know, we're argumentative.

14
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.170
classroom: We're trying to make a scene, so to speak, right?

15
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.629
classroom: And, and we, of course, will have to do some research, so that's what most people would do in a, in a, in a university, right?

16
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.800
classroom: But then…

17
00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:12.010
classroom: what makes this course different is that we try to bridge the research in the university with the public policy discussion, okay? So we try to make some recommendations to the government staff about how they can do a better job.

18
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:25.040
classroom: Alright? So that's why, as I mentioned earlier, one of the starting assumptions of this course is that we believe the government can do a better job, and there's room for improvement in what they do.

19
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.110
classroom: Okay.

20
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.010
classroom: I would assume that we all agree, right? So there's always room for improvement.

21
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.680
classroom: But then the question is, Number one, how do you do research about public policy?

22
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.240
classroom: Right? Where are you gonna do with EHOP?

23
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.879
classroom: Well, in a course like this.

24
00:02:47.240 --> 00:03:00.070
classroom: even when you work in team, you don't have the resources to collect primary data, right? You can't really go to the site and collect a lot of data to do your research. That's not really what this course is about.

25
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.599
classroom: So our approach, or our weapon, or so-called secret weapon, is what we call code of access to information.

26
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.950
classroom: All right? So call access to information is…

27
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.739
classroom: We couldn't… we didn't… we don't really call it a law, it's more… more about just,

28
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:32.110
classroom: kind of a code or a system. But still, it's useful, because under the call on Access to Information, you can actually write letters to the government.

29
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:41.859
classroom: Okay, you can write letters to the government, and you can ask them questions, and expect them to answer in about 21 days. That's 3 weeks.

30
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.660
classroom: Okay, so let's, let's watch this, very short video.

31
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.160
classroom: Oh, okay.

32
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.370
classroom: Hold on.

33
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.829
classroom: Oh, can you hear me now?

34
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.640
classroom: Okay.

35
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.749
classroom: So let's, let's watch this, short video together.

36
00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:44.149
Audio shared by classroom: Take a guess, but we don't have to guess if it is transparent. You need no guesswork to get information from the government. The public can make requests for information under the Code on Access to Information.

37
00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.849
Audio shared by classroom: Visit www.access.gov.hk to find out more.

38
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:15.519
classroom: Okay, so this is actually our secret weapon, because, when we do research, we can't just rely on the, website, right? Of course, you can search the internet, you can get information, about, you know, different issues and policies, but then you also, what we can do is actually

39
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.619
classroom: raise questions, okay? Email the government staff and ask them to provide information.

40
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.540
classroom: So that, that's, that's a very important step, in our course. But then,

41
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.530
classroom: We do research, we make some arguments about how the government can do a better job.

42
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.049
classroom: Then, what? What's the next step?

43
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.100
classroom: Of course, you can just email them and say, look, this is what you should do, blah blah blah, but then…

44
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.660
classroom: then they may not pay attention, right? So how can we make sure that they listen?

45
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.330
classroom: Well, one thing we do is we actually, write letters to the editor.

46
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.930
classroom: In South Korean Morning Post. And this is a letter I hope everybody can read a little bit.

47
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.220
classroom: Can you all access to this letter?

48
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.899
classroom: It's from the… from the page, I just,

49
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.660
classroom: Let me send a link to the…

50
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.900
classroom: to a group.

51
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.430
classroom: But as I said, you should be able to access through the,

52
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.380
classroom: the page.

53
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:04.890
classroom: Now, the reason why this is so important, because this letter, I was invited To write this letter.

54
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:16.370
classroom: to celebrate South China Morning Post's 120th anniversary. So this is a pretty, I think it's an honor for me to, to, contribute this piece.

55
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:26.260
classroom: together with Mark Peeker. So Mark Peeker is actually another, regular, contributor to the To the column.

56
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.290
classroom: Okay.

57
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:37.090
classroom: So let's… let's read this together, because basically, you will get a sense of what we are trying to do here, in this course through… through this, letter.

58
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:52.369
classroom: So I kind of tried to trace back my journey. I started, writing letters, or writing for this session in 2013, so it's, like, 13 years ago.

59
00:07:52.650 --> 00:08:01.539
classroom: And, by, 20… 2023, so that… this was… that letter was… this letter was published.

60
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.869
classroom: I already published over 100 letters.

61
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.830
classroom: But more importantly, I work with my colleague.

62
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:15.539
classroom: And together, we have helped over 300 students to publish letters as well.

63
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:23.639
classroom: Because the maximum number of authors that each letter can have is 3.

64
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:30.689
classroom: So if you form a group and work on a project, three of you can jointly publish a letter together.

65
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.240
classroom: Right?

66
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:45.949
classroom: So, over 300 students together published nearly 140 letters, so this is obviously not the most updated numbers, but you can see that's kind of one of our, accomplishments.

67
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.830
classroom: of this course.

68
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.739
classroom: Now, if you read on, you can see that,

69
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.970
classroom: You know, there's quite a number of milestones.

70
00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.560
classroom: Including this one.

71
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.420
classroom: So this is actually a letter that…

72
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:13.050
classroom: I would argue that this is the first letter in the history of South China Morning Post that was co-authored, or with AI's contribution.

73
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.030
classroom: Okay?

74
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:24.440
classroom: Because near the end of the letter, it says, this letter was written without input and light rewrites by ChatGPT.

75
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.690
classroom: Okay?

76
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.549
classroom: And, this was back in…

77
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.949
classroom: February 2023, so at the time, KGPT was only 3 years old.

78
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.170
classroom: I'm sorry, 3 months old.

79
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.739
classroom: 3 months old.

80
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.300
classroom: Okay?

81
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.829
classroom: But now it's more than 3 years ago.

82
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.090
classroom: Now… The next paragraph…

83
00:09:51.590 --> 00:10:05.260
classroom: talk about our approach. The letters column offers us opportunities to critically review the decisions made by the Hong Kong government, and this is essentially what this course is about. Critically review the decisions made by the Hong Kong government.

84
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:22.769
classroom: Through researching public policy matters, including citing the code on access to information, we have published letters on a wide range of issues, such as emergency alert system, national security law, and solo weather. So you can see there's a wide range of topics that we cover.

85
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:32.450
classroom: Occasionally, government staff, for example, the Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Observatory, would write in response.

86
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.930
classroom: Right? So that's also something quite,

87
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.159
classroom: Interesting, because when we write something in the newspaper.

88
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:51.869
classroom: The government staff may write in response, so we can have, essentially, a public conversation about different public issues, public, policy issues.

89
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:54.960
classroom: Alright.

90
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.310
classroom: So that's, that's also quite, quite important.

91
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.679
classroom: And our conversation with the government extended beyond the newspaper.

92
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.870
classroom: We also s… Set up a meeting with lawmakers.

93
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:17.549
classroom: Unfortunately, all these, these four lawmakers are no longer part of the new legislative council.

94
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:26.529
classroom: But, we had meetings with them, okay? We had meetings with them, and, it's also something related to the…

95
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:31.719
classroom: to the, to the letters. Okay, we, we also read letters about it.

96
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.440
classroom: For example, we…

97
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:48.710
classroom: I couldn't remember the meeting we had with Meet the Chad. Yeah, actually, we had to…

98
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:57.880
classroom: We had a meeting with Mr. Chen, To talk about the… Quarantine, quarantine, isolation.

99
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:04.000
classroom: Arrangement for the incoming freshmen from inland China.

100
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.330
classroom: So that was during the pandemic, 2021, year 2021.

101
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.630
classroom: Okay.

102
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:19.280
classroom: Alright, so… so that's how… you can see that it's not surprising efforts, there's also the opportunity to meet with the lawmakers.

103
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.080
classroom: I can tell you how we can do that.

104
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:30.460
classroom: And finally, this column is also an opportunity to kind of, talk about research.

105
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:31.440
classroom: Right?

106
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.250
classroom: That's probably not necessarily the, the, the most,

107
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:43.290
classroom: Kind of priority for this course, but there's always the opportunity to use this column to educate the public about science.

108
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:56.280
classroom: For example, we wrote a letter about Chinese medicine, And, we also… Wrote the letter about,

109
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.730
classroom: Company emission monitoring.

110
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:01.980
classroom: Okay?

111
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:16.399
classroom: All right, so I think, this, this letter is, just, very important, and, it, it's nicely summarized what we're trying to do here.

112
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:25.200
classroom: And we do projects together, project-based learning with AI assistance and personalized guidance.

113
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.579
classroom: That's also, what we're trying to do here.

114
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:35.409
classroom: Now, let's watch a short video on a course, because this course actually won an award.

115
00:13:42.700 --> 00:14:07.390
Audio shared by classroom: GCAP3056 is an award-winning general education capstone course that Ben and I co-develop and co-teach for the Language Center and the Department of English. The course is designed to empower students to conduct research on policies and programs of the Hong Kong government, and then they share their insights by writing in the South China Morning Post letters column. I help students to develop their research skills

116
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:16.750
Audio shared by classroom: communicate their findings effectively in writing. I also help students in understanding the social issues and the role of the government policies in addressing these social issues.

117
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.700
Audio shared by classroom: I hope that I was able to open up some possible topic areas for student project work.

118
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:34.269
Audio shared by classroom: Based on my own research interests in the LGBT plus community in Hong Kong and Asia. They were able to formulate a convincing argument on the need for better gender and sexuality inclusivity initiatives as a letter to the SCMP.

119
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:45.429
Audio shared by classroom: We also collaborated on writing letters to the editor in the South China Morning Post as a way to demonstrate to our students the kind of writing and engagement with public discourse that we expect of in the course.

120
00:14:45.840 --> 00:15:08.570
Audio shared by classroom: And actually having the opportunity to publish an article in a leading newspaper in Hong Kong is a real highlight of the course. Students find it rewarding to have their voices heard by the community through this publication. We also hope that students will develop the skills and confidence to engage in informed public schools and make a difference in their community. And we also hope that it'll actually be in

121
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:15.459
Audio shared by classroom: I'm inspired to continue being active citizens and contribute to the public good long after the course is over.

122
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.640
Audio shared by classroom: Sustainable peace is mainly based…

123
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.799
classroom: So, that's a very short-term video introducing the course.

124
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.220
classroom: Alright, any questions?

125
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:43.109
classroom: Okay, so, then we can move on, you know, you can refer to this, page here, you know, talking about the silos and everything.

126
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:48.350
classroom: Now, let's look at week one, alright? So please come to week one.

127
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.089
classroom: So this week, well, again, as I said, you know, we're still kind of with the shopping period.

128
00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.480
classroom: Agile.

129
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.170
classroom: For students who just arrived, hi.

130
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:09.149
classroom: Do you… do you have, are you in our WhatsApp group?

131
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.020
classroom: Now, you know what's happening? Okay, so you have the leak, right?

132
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.620
classroom: I just shared a link, you know, one step through.

133
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.899
classroom: All right.

134
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:26.800
classroom: Okay, so… As I mentioned earlier.

135
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:32.940
classroom: One of the assumptions of this course is that there's always room for improvement in the government's work.

136
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:39.759
classroom: But if we want to look at this at a more kind of theoretical perspective.

137
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.500
classroom: Then I want to refer to this quote.

138
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.410
classroom: from Thomas Payne.

139
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:51.129
classroom: Government, even in its best state, is for the necessary evil.

140
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.990
classroom: And it's worth it and the intolerable one.

141
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.529
classroom: So the notion that government is a necessary evil

142
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:06.149
classroom: I think that's actually something we want to consider. I know it can be kind of a pretty radical notion.

143
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:13.690
classroom: But remember, we… well, I mean, not necessarily we, but Thomas Paine says that the government's evil.

144
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.609
classroom: Because, conceit of the fact that

145
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:21.149
classroom: The government as an agency would take away some of our money.

146
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:27.859
classroom: Right? Your hard-earned money will be taken away from the government in the form of taxation.

147
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:33.739
classroom: And there's a lot of laws and rules that would restrict people's freedom.

148
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:42.920
classroom: And threatened to infringe people's rights, because the government has got the power And, violence.

149
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:50.739
classroom: Okay, so the government is the only legal, authority or legal entities that can actually

150
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.679
classroom: Inflict pain and violence on people.

151
00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.210
classroom: Right? Through, through jail, through police.

152
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.250
classroom: So that's why.

153
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:12.520
classroom: At the various theoretical level, we consider government as evil, but then at the same time, it's a necessary evil, because we do rely on the government to protect us, to offer different services.

154
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:21.070
classroom: Okay? So this tension between evil and necessity would… leads to…

155
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:27.419
classroom: The fact, or the argument, that we have to hold the government accountable.

156
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:38.169
classroom: Right? We have to watch the government very carefully, and make sure that they do not do things that are not reasonable, right?

157
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:54.869
classroom: So, that's why accountability is so important. We want to hold the government staff accountable, and another related concept is transparency. We want to get as much information as possible about how the government is doing its work, because

158
00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:01.270
classroom: Being transparent is the prerequisite for holding someone accountable, right?

159
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:09.250
classroom: Now, I want to offer you another… Example.

160
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:17.609
classroom: And, this is, again, an article that I shared. Can you all access this page?

161
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.890
classroom: I don't know if you need to log into LinkedIn to access

162
00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:02.300
classroom: Now, this… Is an example of how

163
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:10.489
classroom: We can actually make a difference as a private, ordinary citizen or members of the community.

164
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.590
classroom: how to write so the Hong Kong government will listen.

165
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:22.210
classroom: Now, this is actually what happened in the… In my neighborhood.

166
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.860
classroom: Okay? So this is the bus stop.

167
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.300
classroom: Right out, right outside.

168
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.519
classroom: the gate of my neighborhood. So I basically use this bus stop every day.

169
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.600
classroom: Okay?

170
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.289
classroom: And this picture was taken or a Saturday afternoon.

171
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:48.829
classroom: I don't really go outside to, you know, take bus on Saturday afternoon that often, but somehow I have to do something, run an errand or something on that Saturday afternoon.

172
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.080
classroom: And then immediately, I found this… incident.

173
00:20:53.500 --> 00:21:00.990
classroom: which is on a Saturday afternoon, around 4 or 5 PM or something, the bus is so crowded.

174
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:12.019
classroom: Okay? And the reason why it was so crowded is because there's some construction sites in this area, and 5PM is when everybody gets off, finish their work.

175
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.950
classroom: So when I see this, So what would you do?

176
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.409
classroom: What would you do if you see this?

177
00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.000
classroom: Do you consider this unfair or unreasonable?

178
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.740
classroom: Right?

179
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:38.609
classroom: Because, obviously, you know, there's so many, so many people. And actually, the solution is very simple. Increase the frequency of the bus.

180
00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.140
classroom: Because over the weekend, it's very…

181
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.780
classroom: Low frequency, we're talking about every 20 minutes, there will be a bus.

182
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:52.460
classroom: But during this particular, kind of, atypical rush hours, Ain't…

183
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.560
classroom: We have to do something about it. Now.

184
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.889
classroom: The first thing I do is I write to the transport department.

185
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.430
classroom: Okay.

186
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.670
classroom: Now, one thing you have to remember.

187
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:12.800
classroom: That's a little trick, you know, even if you, even if you're not coming back to take this course, or whatever.

188
00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.119
classroom: You can learn this new trick, okay?

189
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.469
classroom: Trick number one, whenever you deal with the home of government.

190
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.400
classroom: Do not take their phone call.

191
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:29.250
classroom: Okay, never, ever take their phone call. Because when they talk to you over the phone, that's basically, like, there's no records.

192
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:38.139
classroom: You see what I mean? There's no way for you to kind of follow up to, to, to, you know, hold them accountable. So never take phone calls, always insist on writing.

193
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.249
classroom: Alright? So, so that's, that's rule number one.

194
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:46.569
classroom: Now, the second thing is, you have to think about how you frame this E2.

195
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:54.779
classroom: Because the first thing I do is I write to the transport department, so I frame this issue as an issue of bus service quality.

196
00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:02.779
classroom: Right? Because, because transport department is, is responsible for, for kind of improve and enhance the quality of bus service.

197
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.119
classroom: So I read to them, but then they didn't respond.

198
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.580
classroom: Quickly enough.

199
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.089
classroom: After the whole week, the second week, the same situation.

200
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:19.750
classroom: The same crowded bus, because all the workers trying to get home, go home, after finishing their work.

201
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.630
classroom: So… What would you do?

202
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.730
classroom: When the transport department doesn't work, what do you… what would you do?

203
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.529
classroom: So you can't really frame this issue as service quality, right?

204
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.780
classroom: Or it's not urgent enough. It takes a whole week, but nothing happened.

205
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.620
classroom: So, what I'll do next?

206
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.509
classroom: It's a right to the police.

207
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:52.310
classroom: Okay? I write it to the police, because when I write to the police, the issue, the nature of the issue changes.

208
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.630
classroom: from corridor service, to public safety.

209
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:05.049
classroom: Okay? So I start arguing that, look, there's so many people, so many passengers in this bus, this is a safety concern.

210
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.970
classroom: Okay? So I write to them, and they say, look, you have to start doing something.

211
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.769
classroom: Don't… So then the next Saturday, it was a rainy day, but I still go there.

212
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.519
classroom: And you see the politicians here.

213
00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:28.929
classroom: Okay, so the police officer showed up, Because it's my email.

214
00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.480
classroom: You see what I mean?

215
00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:35.220
classroom: Okay? Never call them, okay? Don't call them.

216
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.569
classroom: Because when you call them, they can dismiss you very quickly.

217
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.430
classroom: But when you email them, They help you take action.

218
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.840
classroom: Alright.

219
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:52.160
classroom: So then, this is a heavy ending, because after this, you know,

220
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.310
classroom: All the workers can enjoy more crowd space.

221
00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.730
classroom: I think that's one of the reasons we want to be educated, right?

222
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:10.660
classroom: Because once you become educated, you learn how to do this kind of thing, right, to the government, hold them accountable, and then we're helping those who are less educated.

223
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:15.540
classroom: You see what I mean? The less privileged people, in our community.

224
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:19.399
classroom: We're trying to help them. And this is an example of how we can help them.

225
00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:34.590
classroom: And, you can also look at this letter, which was written by my student.

226
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:40.110
classroom: And this is a letter that actually talks about, column…

227
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.950
classroom: We can complain against the police.

228
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.370
classroom: Right?

229
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.800
classroom: Most important thing is, we have this telephone directory of Hong Kong government.

230
00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:00.600
classroom: Okay, so this is actually something that you can… you can learn and you can take away from.

231
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:07.479
classroom: Alright, so you go to the government terminal directory, And there's a full list.

232
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.220
classroom: And, you see, most people don't know this.

233
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.349
classroom: But it's actually publicly available.

234
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.590
classroom: Anyone can come here. So next time, if you are not happy with the police.

235
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:27.809
classroom: But I hope, of course, I hope you won't have… you won't have that as a problem.

236
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.730
classroom: But just in case you want to,

237
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.250
classroom: File a complaint or something.

238
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.729
classroom: You don't… you don't go here directly, right? But… but the… the… the top guy.

239
00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.910
classroom: A commission of the police, there's an email.

240
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.230
classroom: For his office, right?

241
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:52.130
classroom: But usually, you want to start with… A specific region.

242
00:26:52.410 --> 00:27:04.970
classroom: Like, what I did is I start with the Taipo region, because this is what happened in Taipo, right? So, I start with the Taipo region, there's a director, there's a commander, or whatever, officer there. I emailed to him.

243
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.009
classroom: And they said, look, you better do something about it.

244
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.840
classroom: And if they don't do anything, and then you can go up one level.

245
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:21.620
classroom: and complain again. And then go up another level, you see what I mean?

246
00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:27.839
classroom: That's how you deal with not just police, but any government department.

247
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.139
classroom: Because you don't want to just write an email to the inquiry hotline, you see what I mean?

248
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.169
classroom: You'll have to go here.

249
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.869
classroom: And then it would be much more effective.

250
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.320
classroom: Alright, so…

251
00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:50.530
classroom: I think this is where I'd like to pause, and maybe hear what you have to say.

252
00:27:51.580 --> 00:28:00.190
classroom: And what you can do is come to week one, And come to this… page.

253
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.410
classroom: Under tools, two principles that guide our work.

254
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.489
classroom: And, you can log in

255
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.790
classroom: So, the way you log in is this.

256
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.459
classroom: You go to the… you click on login.

257
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.329
classroom: and then you are new to decide, so you put your… the last four digits of your student ID,

258
00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:31.859
classroom: Okay, this way I can… I will know who you are. And then the first name and last name initial, only the letter, the first letter, okay, not the whole,

259
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.230
classroom: Not everything.

260
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:40.029
classroom: Okay, so let me just do a quick demo here.

261
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:57.089
classroom: So, suppose the last four digits, is, for me, is 0001, and the first thing you need to pay, the last name is L,

262
00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.510
classroom: And then I will get a… That's a lady.

263
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.430
classroom: Okay?

264
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:12.980
classroom: So, I will grab this… this is my platform ID. Now, when you log in with your platform ID, you want to make sure that

265
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:20.550
classroom: you remember this, okay? Because next time, you need this ID to… Come back.

266
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:24.470
classroom: And everything you do here will be saved.

267
00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:26.640
classroom: Blue is record.

268
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:31.710
classroom: Okay? So what you should do now, everybody, is to…

269
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.740
classroom: copy this, platform ID, and send it to me.

270
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.169
classroom: Okay? Send to me through WhatsApp.

271
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.719

295
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:41.539
classroom: what question would you ask the government about the… well, actually, oh, sorry. The first question is, is if you could hold the whole government itself accountable in one area, what would it be, and how?

296
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:51.149
classroom: Think about the specific government decision or practice you want to change. Who is responsible, what would you want them to do differently, and give an example.

297
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.649
classroom: So that's the first question.

298
00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.150
classroom: Do you know where it is?

299
00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:04.730
classroom: It's, in week one, Accountability and transparency.

300
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:11.840
classroom: Okay?

301
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.970
classroom: So there are 3 questions here.

302
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.940
classroom: Excuse me.

303
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.970

classroom: I think you already got in. You can send a message.

307
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:31.949
classroom: So basically, it's… it's here, right? So, accountability and transparency. It's under tools, two principles that guide our work.

308
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.489
classroom: And then here, there's, like, 3 places.

309
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.279
classroom: Now, please see if you can,

310
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.080
classroom: If you can leave a message.

311
00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:55.759
classroom: You know, when you leave a message, you should be able to see it right away.

312
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:09.220
classroom: Oh, they ask for at least 10 characters.

313
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:26.610
classroom: Okay, so just write a few words. These are the questions for you to kind of,

314
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:35.579
classroom: think about. So, hopefully have a more relevant learning experience, yes.

315
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.300
classroom: Oh,

316
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.209
classroom: We need a couple of them.

317
00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:49.560
classroom: Good luck.

318
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:19.240
classroom: Okay, so one student said, I would like to focus on housing policy accountability. The second for housing should ensure more transparent allocation of public housing.

319
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:26.149
classroom: By implementing a fairer lottery system, people could reduce waiting time and increase accessibility for low-income families.

320
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.469

classroom: Sounds good.

323
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.130
classroom: It's a good answer.

324
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.899
classroom: Okay, another student said I would,

325
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:51.659
classroom: Hold the Hong government staff accountable for transparency in decision-making, especially regarding land development.

326
00:41:51.880 --> 00:42:05.910
classroom: The responsible officials should openly disclose the criteria and process behind zoning and housing projects. For example, instead of a secret negotiation with developers, they should publish detailed plans and rationales to ensure public trust and prevent corruption.

327
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.150
classroom: Cool. Thank you.

classroom: It would be compelling.

353
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:48.720
classroom: Oh, okay, so is that transdisciplinary?

354
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:49.770
classroom: Okay.

355
00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.950

356
00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.759

357

classroom: But… We'll see.

361
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:28.060
classroom: Okay, so, let me see if there's any… more comments.

362
00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:31.470
classroom: That we can get.

363
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:40.270
classroom: Long waiting time for public hospital queues.

364
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.020
classroom: different dimensions.

365
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.079
classroom: Now, once you have your first

366
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:02.279
classroom: kind of the issue that you want to identify, you want to focus on. Then the next question is.

367
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:06.360
classroom: What information you can collect from the government?

368
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.789
classroom: So what question would you ask the government about the issue you raised above?

369
00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:30.040
classroom: Okay, so, feel free to add your answers to these questions.

370
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:35.639
classroom: Because it will help you to better understand the course materials and points.

371
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:42.439
classroom: Now, I'd like to bring your attention to the resources There's an assessment

372
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:46.360
classroom: Okay, so I want to talk about assessment just a little bit.

373
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:54.799
classroom: In this course, we will have three components

374
00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.670
classroom: 65% of this course will be group work.

375
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:05.399
classroom: Usually, the group size is 4 to 5.

376
00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.660
classroom: Okay?

377
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:13.370
classroom: But, yeah, I mean, if we have, say, 15 students, then it would be 3 groups.

378
00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:19.400
classroom: We… well, if we only got under 20 students, maybe we can have smaller groups.

379
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:29.359
classroom: But of course, you know, there's under some circumstances that could be the case that students could work individually, but usually it's working groups.

380
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:36.690
classroom: And, you know, you have to write, An argumentative research paper.

381
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:44.360
classroom: And that paper could be submitted to the lawmaker, to the legislative council, which accounts for 25%.

382
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.980
classroom: And, the community engagement would…

383
00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:57.470
classroom: Account for 40%, and that will include 3 pieces.

384
00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:06.139
classroom: The evidence for requesting information, So, you need to document the process of getting information from the government.

385
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:09.520
classroom: The evidence of writing for the public.

386
00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:15.139
classroom: And also, some visual communication about your case.

387
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:18.300
classroom: Again, it's to engage the community.

388
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:30.220
classroom: And then there's the Reflective Learning Journal. That's a heavy one. It's 35%, and it also is individually worked.

389
00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.860
classroom: Inevitably assessed?

390
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:40.239
classroom: So… We'll provide you more prompts and questions to write that.

391
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:51.210
classroom: So, overall speaking, the workload is… is very reasonable, okay? And, we try to…

392
00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.570
classroom: Finish everything by week 11, alright?

393
00:53:55.690 --> 00:54:03.699
classroom: So, you know, in terms of the specific deadlines, I need to adjust a little bit.

394
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:11.470
classroom: So I, I count… provide the info at this stage, but it will be provided in due course.

395
00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:30.279
classroom: Now, in terms of the group projects.

396
00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.160
classroom: Here are a couple of options.

397
00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:38.259
classroom: Now, you need to go to Resources and then Group Projects.

398
00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.259
classroom: So you come to this page.

399
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:46.249
classroom: So, we have a total of 6 options.

400
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:52.979
classroom: The first one is, fire safety accountability.

401
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:58.079
classroom: You know, we all know the very unfortunate event.

402
00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:03.189
classroom: the fire in Taekong last November.

403
00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:10.010
classroom: So… We're gonna do a project on this, if you're interested.

404
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:15.139
classroom: The basic question is, did the Pfizer recipient learn from the Grand Fair?

405
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.970
classroom: Tower Fire in London.

406
00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:19.780
classroom: Okay.

407
00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:29.579
classroom: So we want to review to what extent, fire service department staff have, reviewed and looked at past incidents to learn lessons.

408
00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:32.640
classroom: And then to enhance the spy safety.

409
00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:36.230
classroom: standards. So that's the… that's the first project.

410
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:41.149
classroom: The second project is about e-health. Okay, e-health has been around for…

411
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:48.670
classroom: More than 10 years now, I think. I think this year is the 10th anniversary.

412
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:56.129
classroom: And we've done this work… done work in this area before, so this would be good to kind of follow up.

413
00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:01.320
classroom: If you have medical background, or… Arabic?

414
00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:08.679
classroom: you… your major is about health, right? So, you may want to consider pursuing this.

415
00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:13.080
classroom: And, we all know that recently,

416
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.369
classroom: government increased the public hospital charge.

417
00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:22.119
classroom: And, for the low-income family, it could become less affordable.

418
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:31.410
classroom: So… That's why, maybe we want to look at how the low-income family

419
00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:39.200
classroom: Households, or people from low-income households could apply for the fee exemption or reduction.

422
00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:06.870

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:43.579
classroom: You're not going to suggest?

451
01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.010
classroom: Policy address is, it's, like, the annual speech?

452
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.539
classroom: that the Chief Executive would give.

464
01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:15.159
classroom: All right, so we do have a tentative, plan for the rest of the semester. You can… you can take a look, but, at this stage, it's… it's not, confirmed, because, you know, we have to adjust the schedule based on different, factors.

465
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:21.209
classroom: Week two, we're going to do some research focusing on public information.

466

classroom: Right? Just, just like a library research.

467
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:33.430
classroom: And this is where we want to get to know the topic a bit more and gather all the contextual information.

468
01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:41.460
classroom: And, we will start, raising some questions and sharpen the focus of the project.

469
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:51.909
classroom: And then week 3 is when we will actually finalize all the questions we're going to send to the government. So, week 3, we plan to email the government.

470
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:56.370
classroom: Okay, and then 3 weeks later, we will get a reply.

471
01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:06.629
classroom: Before, we will start outlining and drafting our report to the Legislative Council.

472
01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:14.809
classroom: We'll start early, because, you know, we'll be the community engagement portfolio, and also the report.

473
01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:27.369
classroom: And then, week five, we look at writing letters to the editor, but again, you know, all the topics, it's subject to change, we may have to adjust.

474
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.729
classroom: And by week 6, we will get our government reply back.

475
01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:35.190
classroom: Okay, so we're going to evaluate governance responses.

476
01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:46.170
classroom: Hopefully by week 7, we're gonna have a field trip to, you know, visit the newsroom.

477
01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.590
classroom: of Hong Kong Free Press.

478
01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:53.100
classroom: I'm still, trying to get hold on the editor-in-chief.

479
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.880
classroom: And hopefully, he will host us.

480
01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:02.119
classroom: And then there's the, visual communication workshop in week 8.

481
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:09.289
classroom: And then week 9, Week now would be consultation, week 10 and consultation again.

482
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:12.289
classroom: We will prepare for the community outreach.

483
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:17.749
classroom: And, we will do the community outreach on campus.

484
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.870
classroom: Most likely, it's going to be on campus, set up the booth and everything.

485
01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:26.289
classroom: And then, we're gonna wrap up the course.

486
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.289
classroom: So that's kind of the tentative schedule.

487
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:35.739
classroom: We will have a lot of group meetings as well, so…

488
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.580
classroom: we don't necessarily will, like, do lecturing all the time. Instead,

489
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:49.380
classroom: Because it's a project-based learning, experiential learning, So… Yup.

490
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:53.080
classroom: What else?

491
01:07:54.160 --> 01:08:01.850
classroom: Everybody will get $300 as subsidy for, doing projects, so you will get some money from the school.

492
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.919
classroom: To support your project.

493
01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:06.220
classroom: Okay.

494
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:10.330
classroom: But, I think that's… That's about it.

495
01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:24.700
classroom: So, Samia, do you have any question?

496
01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:51.029
classroom: Hold on.

497
01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:05.879
classroom: Oh, yes, yes, it will be, it will be on Moodle. I will set up a Moodle, assignment soon.

498
01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:18.179
classroom: That'd be awesome.

499
01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:24.549
classroom: Well, I guess we can… we can find a specific framework.

500
01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:35.000
classroom: But then the thing is, this is… Thanks so much.

501
01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:37.200
classroom: Yep.

502
01:09:37.819 --> 01:09:38.659
classroom: What was it?

503
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:42.929
classroom: Next week, we'll definitely, said blah blah.

504
01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:54.260
classroom: Okay, anything else?

505
01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:18.350
classroom: If not, then I think that's all for today. If you decided to stay in this course, you need to do me a favor and try to spread the word and invite your friends. Because, as I said, you, you know, we have a 15 minimum requirement for enrollment.

506
01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:25.519
classroom: So, there's, you know, I don't know whether other… because on paper, we got 17.

507
01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:27.390
classroom: students.

508
01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:31.179
classroom: But, it's… it's not,

509
01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:33.450
classroom: It's not safe enough, you know?

510
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:43.400
classroom: I remember… lost… Last semester, I got a full house, like, 25.

511
01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:49.079
classroom: But, you know, usually the screen centers, it's just fewer students.

512
01:10:49.650 --> 01:10:51.110
classroom: I don't have no idea why.

513
01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:57.220
classroom: But… I'll see you next week, then.
