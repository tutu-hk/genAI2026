Speaker 1  0:00  
Lay down the number of government departments, and we have decided to remove EOC because, as we said before, it's not actually department, right?

Simon H WANG  0:12  
I'm recording this just for our records. Okay,

Speaker 1  0:15  
that's fine. I'm trying to request data two departments for each. So in total, four, right? So Joyce will be working on EDB, education Bureau, yeah, and Department of Justice, and I'm working on UGC, university government, okay, and the security bureau, school Bureau, yes.

Simon H WANG  0:41  
So what's the overall like research question, or what our hypothesis?

Speaker 1  0:49  
Our hypothesis is that we believe that the low reporting ways for sexual harassment and assault exists because our current education programs are voluntary and social misconceptions persist, like such as the frozen versus,

Simon H WANG  1:16  
yeah, I think I'll work on that. I'll do the analysis right. See, the thing is, if you are following up with four different units, DOJ, education Bureau, UGC and Security Bureau, then you need to have, like, at least four recommendation, like one recommendation for each department, right? Each unit, right? I guess. The thing is, before we approach the different units for information or whatever, we need to first sort of look at the current state, like existing mechanisms or solution to this problem, and see there could be some like room for improvement or whatever. So that's the critical review. And then we can say, hey, we want to make a very strong argument about why and how this improvement should be done then, but we need data with the government. Give us the data. It depends on, it depends on whether they have the data number one, and whether releasing the data would be access acceptable for them, because there could be, there could be different reasons why they reject our applications and sometimes, which, well, I think it's actually very often the staff will dodge our questions. So we asked a couple of questions, but they don't really answer them. They just give some reply,

Speaker 1  2:55  
which that's why we are doing the two per department, because I'm fully expecting to them to give half

Simon H WANG  3:03  
answers, yeah, okay, yeah, right.

Speaker 1  3:07  
So if they get, so, if we receive half answers, then, then we could only do limited recommendation,

Simon H WANG  3:15  
okay, yeah, yeah. How about you? You, you drop something. Okay, drop something, whether it's questions or it could be just a hypothesis, and also look at the current like whatever data or pages you have found. Maybe we'll go online to see what, to get some information and work with it. Then I can do the analysis with

Unknown Speaker  3:39  
those information. We can do okay? So

Unknown Speaker  3:42  
I potency, say whatever

Speaker 1  3:45  
and do some.

Simon H WANG  4:00  
Maybe I use correlation, whatever, to get the analysis. I just assume, because I don't think they will give us any data. Well, depends on how you ask the question. Well, they have some, some obligation, but, but, yeah, let me know how it goes. We use, if they don't give us the assume, okay,

Unknown Speaker  4:24  
drop in some emails, and let's do a expect the outcome.

Simon H WANG  4:31  
We need to have, like a critical review of the current mechanism as well. So, so do a bit more search, or look at, look at the web search done by AI and see how useful they are. If they're not very useful, let me know I can do another round. Or you can try it on IDE as well. No, you are the computer science major. You can, you can ask AI to to do the search for us. Okay, so file service, Team Two, right? So, have you got any progress, right? Fire Service Department, have you found which unit, which unit within the government fire service department is responsible for this education. Do you know the government directory? You can go to the government directory. Actually, I put it in the in the web search. So I think the web search link because the fire service department got a whole bureaucratic structure, right? So, so you need to, you need to look at that full list and then decide which particular team you want to approach. Okay, so can you find, find that it's called government directory, fire service. Yeah, yeah. Not here. You need to go to full list, and then government department, and then fire service department, and see you can see there's a whole structure, so you need to figure out which unit right to work on. But I think, I think maybe go go to that follow up report, follow up page or something file in the agent in the directory, you may be able to find something there, but yeah, find that and try to come up with some questions for the government. Come up with a hypothesis as well. Okay, thank you. Great. So have you got a focus? We're talking about legislative council data. So what's the, what's the, what could be the case study for

Unknown Speaker  7:21  
them? Accessibility for them

Simon H WANG  7:23  
built the accessibility. I know accessibility of data is the main concern, right? But my question is, do you have a use case? What kind of data are we talking about here?

Speaker 2  7:35  
Oh, because for like, for now, most of, most of the data are only like, scan files. It's not really like,

Simon H WANG  7:48  
Oh, okay. Well, again, that's a technical issue. What I'm suggesting is that we need to focus on one type of data that a lot of people would be interested in. It could be journalist, it could be general public. But, but we need to find some, some focus, you

Speaker 2  8:09  
say, me most of the data, like the member questions and like the debate inside the meetings, okay, and the build progress,

Simon H WANG  8:19  
build progress. And actually, actually, I have, I have an idea, but I think it can be quite dangerous, is to review the attendance of the lawmakers in all the meetings, if you visualize it and rank, you know, what's the, what's the percentage of attendance of each member?

Speaker 2  8:41  
And, like, I think, because, for now, most they have, like, as you said, they have, like, seven databases, many, I don't know this is seven, but yeah. And one difficulty is that if you want some data, you need to go to Database A and then another one you need to go to because so maybe they can just combine it

Simon H WANG  9:02  
over to one. So, okay, so you want to build a case for integration. All right, all this data machine readable, or API access, or

Speaker 2  9:14  
some has API access, and some, some are readable, and some are, like, just only scan PDFs,

Simon H WANG  9:19  
but, but can we, like, write a web crawler to Download everything?

Unknown Speaker  9:25  
Some can because, like,

Unknown Speaker  9:34  
on the website, I

Simon H WANG  9:43  
I think, I think we have some pretty good ideas and direction, but we just need, we just need a use case to kind of justify and, you know, build the argument. Okay, great, let's, let's, let's take a closer look. Okay, how about your team? We got any progress.

Unknown Speaker  10:11  
We find billion dollars of funding after the fire so we can, we can find the coast cost benefit and

Simon H WANG  10:22  
what was, what's the funding for,

Unknown Speaker  10:29  
just for fire safety after that, fire,

Simon H WANG  10:32  
Oh, you mean the government pounds. You mean, you mean the London Yeah, and then fire, oh, okay,

Speaker 3  10:41  
after the fire, government made that funding about like 900 900 billions. 900 1500 billions.

Simon H WANG  10:51  
15 five billions, 5 billion. Yeah, five billions from the London Government or British government, British government. So how does it relate to the Hong Kong case.

Speaker 3  11:02  
So, because now there is no official, official results from the government, so we can see if, if Hong Kong governments, just like UK Government, make up funding like that fire, and we can, we want to make a cost benefit analysis just is to show if there is no this funding after the fire, and these old buildings are not protected, if there is one more fire, the cost is much bigger than

Simon H WANG  11:38  
Okay, so you are saying that maybe we want to explore whether the Hong Kong government should learn from the London or British government follow their example to set up a fund. Okay, so, yeah, sure. I think that could be a very good yeah, focus. Can you send me the links about the funding, and also some ideas regarding, you know what, what you plan to do, and or another possibility is you can, you can send, put the put together. Fine, ask AI agent to follow up. Okay, yeah,

Speaker 3  12:17  
we must build the I am agent to help others.

Simon H WANG  12:20  
I wouldn't say you must, but I would strongly encourage you to try it. You don't really build an agent. You just kind of set up a workflow, because I did a demo, right? Yeah. Do you? Does it make sense? Yeah. So you can, you can set up some file. Okay, great. All right, so what's up?

Simon H WANG  12:56  
This is the I think it should be the same. Is the same? Oh, because you, because you didn't synchronize. You need to go back to synchronize. You have to go to here, this one. Go to GitHub. Go here.

Simon H WANG  13:37  
No, you go back to GitHub because you, you fork it before, right? It's just click here, yeah, click repository, go to repository. Wait, oh yeah, so this is the one, yeah, click on it. Yeah. You can sync update branch. Now it's up to date, but then this is still different from the workspace version that you're working on, not, not here. I think you got this one right here. Yeah, so you come go to, right So, so you open this, and then you say, sync with GitHub, S, Y, n, C, windy guy was with with GitHub.

Simon H WANG  15:00  
Okay, so got any progress? We are working on E house right here. So well, actually, I think that's a very exciting topic. Do you have any questions? Something you want to discuss

Simon H WANG  15:22  
for you need to enable, yes, you know E house. Do you know E house? Have you downloaded the app? Okay, are you using it. Haggle, yeah, yeah, duplicate functions. Here's the thing. You know, you could read a couple of articles on sound channeling, posts, including some letters I wrote my students wrote on E house. It's a pretty big project. It's been at least 10 years now, there's some new features being produced, and the idea is that the public hospital, private hospital, and private doctors, they can all share the patient's records, right, e house, e House Records. My current proposal would be to look into how this infrastructure, how this whole system, can be used by can be used to facilitate insurance claim and reimbursement, because most people, workers, knowledge workers, or whoever, employees in Hong Kong, they got some coverage, medical insurance. It's the employers buying it, right? So, for example, if I'm sick, I have to see a doctor. I pay for my bills, and then the doctor the hospital training, will give me a receipt, and right now what I need to do is I will submit it to my employer, which is the BU, and then bu will check it or whatever, and then refund it to me, and then insurance company will refund but this can be a time consuming process, especially sometimes they would ask me for original copy, for random checking. Sometimes they asked me for referral letter of some doing some lab test, so that would create more work, you say, I mean, so the kind of the alternative or a better setup would be, what if the medical doctor, a doctor or a hospital, because they have every other document on their computer, right? So they just send all the documents straight to E health, and then the insurance company will also access the same document through E health. And then, you know, I'm not saying that the insurance company should pay the hospital directly or something, but at least maybe I don't have to scan everything and upload it to the system. You see, I mean, sometimes I have to, I have to provide an original copy, because if the, if everybody send, send something to the E house, then the authentic, Authenticity will be guaranteed, right? So, so then we don't have to do random check, we don't have to go through all the process, right? But then, of course, we're not saying that at this stage. We will just, you know, write to the government say you go ahead and set up something for this. That's not possible because, you know, they, they have their own agenda, right? But my most kind of, I think the priority is just to understand the current technical infrastructure, to see to what extent whatever we just said is actually feasible. And this could be the starting point is this could be kind of get started with a conversation. Is, I mean if, if the infrastructure turns out to be quite already friendly, or, you know, supportive of this idea, then we can say, Oh, actually, the tech, technology is already there. And then we can start bullying, not bullying, lobbying the lawmakers or the government to take the next step. So understanding the technical infrastructure of E health is an important step. Another step we might want to take is to look at the E health system in other countries and see if there may be some other countries where insurance is being done in a more efficient way to compare with Hong Kong.

Unknown Speaker  19:48  
Yeah. Academic research is

Simon H WANG  19:54  
about this. Yeah, it's

Unknown Speaker  19:59  
about the privacy, the issue of Hong Kong, this issue, right? Some of the patient, do you think that maybe the information is not,

Simon H WANG  20:15  
not aligned, right, not consistent,

Speaker 4  20:18  
and the function is limited? And also, I found that about some of the doctor, they not settle in this system that still used, like the old system, which about the paperwork instead, yeah, yeah.

Simon H WANG  20:37  
I think that's part of the infrastructure, right,

Unknown Speaker  20:42  
useful to our people to this topic.

Simon H WANG  20:46  
I think it's useful to some extent, because when you find one paper, you can actually find more, a lot of more papers on this same topic. It'll be useful. But again, you know, if I mean actually eHealth has so many different aspects. What I just said is just one possibility, right? If you guys look at all the documents, web pages on the topic, you find something else that you want to explore. You know, we still have time, you know, until next week, we can decide what questions we ask the government. So, yeah, so I think we, yeah, we can. We can still try other options,

Speaker 5  21:31  
like the private doctor upload medical record, right? But one of the problem is that they don't use this function. Yeah. That's why, even though the patient like from upload their medical record from the public hospital, yeah, but if they like visit the private one, no, they can't, like sync the record between the private and,

Simon H WANG  21:56  
yeah, I think we actually requested some information from the government before regarding because we got some some data saying that on average, they only use like, 15 times a year or something. We're talking about access. We're not even talking about, I don't remember it's 15 a month or something, but you are, right. So sometimes even they look at access that the record, which is from public hospital, they don't really upload the private because they want to protect their interest, right? So another possible topic would be what kind of incentive the government should provide, or even pressure, so more private hospital. Maybe start with hospital. If they introduce a policy would be introduced across the

Unknown Speaker  22:54  
board, just focus on hospital,

Simon H WANG  22:58  
private hospital. It's possible. I mean, I mean, um, you, you need to make the decision very quickly, because next week we need to send off the government request. So before that, we need to kind of decide, You know what, what? What would the focus of the project? And then you can decide, you know what questions for the government, because next weeks will be week five so, and we need to wait for like three weeks before we got anything. Sometimes seven weeks. You see seven weeks, right? There's like week 12 already. So, so, yeah, so we need to kind of make some decisions. Yeah. Thank you. Great. You.
