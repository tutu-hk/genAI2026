# Project Meta Director — process log

**Purpose:** Coordinate web search and feedback across all project teams (groups 1–6). Reference: `PerformWebSearch.md`.

**Model:** `courses/gcap3056/group6-rare-disease` (process.log, searchPlan, AIwebsearch/AIsearchReport, hypotheses, HypotheseQuestions).

---

## 1. Scope

- **Groups:** group1-legco-data-access, group2-fire-service-1, group3-eHealth, group4-fire-service-2, group5-prevent-sexual-harassment, group6-rare-disease.
- **Tasks:** (1) Review planNextSteps.md and group6 progress; (2) Perform 5 rounds of web search per project (each round informed by previous); (3) Create WebSearchReport.md per group; (4) Create seekFeedback.md per group; (5) Update this process.log in real time.
- **Teacher:** Will update notes in Google Docs and discuss hypotheses with each group for another round of targeted search.

---

## 2. Review completed

- **group6-rare-disease:** process.log, searchPlan.md, AIwebsearch/AIsearchReport.md, hypotheses.md reviewed. Focus: Mainland procurement vs independent drug regime; 7 queries already run; report has 12+ items. Progress: search done; hypotheses and HypotheseQuestions exist.
- **Groups 1–5:** planNextSteps.md reviewed for each. All follow same workflow (public info → focus → search plan → AI web search/report → hypotheses → questions). Gaps: no search report or hypotheses yet; need WebSearchReport and seekFeedback.

## 3. Round-by-round search (5 rounds per project)

**Method:** For each project, run web searches explicit about how and why; after each round use findings to plan the next. Document in each group’s WebSearchReport.md.

**Format (per searchExpectations.md):** Search results include **clickable links**; **article titles, dates and summaries**; **relevance to project goals**; **follow-up suggestions** for the team.

**Status:**
- **Rounds 1–5 (all in one go):** Completed for all 6 groups. For each group, WebSearchReport.md was updated with: (1) 5 rounds of searches (queries, domain, purpose per round); (2) results with **clickable links**, **title**, **date**, **summary**, **relevance to project goals**, and **follow-up suggestions**; (3) a “Suggestions for the team (follow-up)” section. Group 6 WebSearchReport.md integrates with existing AIwebsearch/AIsearchReport.md and adds the same format for 5 rounds.
- **seekFeedback.md** already in place per group (Google doc update, Moodle task 4.1, teacher doc link). Teacher will discuss hypotheses with each group; further targeted searches can be run after that feedback.

---

## 4. Deliverables

- **WebSearchReport.md** — in each group folder: 5 rounds completed; searches conducted (how and why); results with **clickable links**, **titles**, **dates**, **summaries**, **relevance to project goals**, and **follow-up suggestions** (per searchExpectations.md).
- **seekFeedback.md** — in each group folder: ask team to update Google docs and reply to Moodle task 4.1; link to teacher’s Google doc.
- **process.log** — this file; updated in real time.
