# Teacher To-Do (5 Feb 2026)

Based on the 5 Feb discussion transcript and current project folders. Actions and human input to push projects forward.

---

## Group 1 – LegCo data access

- **Push for a concrete use case**  
  Students have “accessibility” and “integration” ideas but need one clear use case to justify the argument (e.g. one data type many people care about—journalists, public).
- **Suggest optional direction**  
  If useful: “Review attendance of lawmakers across meetings—visualise and rank attendance by member” (noted in transcript as “quite dangerous” but possible angle).
- **Check**  
  That they move from “data are scan files / scattered” to one justified ask (e.g. machine-readable, API, or single portal) tied to that use case.

## Group 2 – Fire Service 1

- **Clarify “London” reference**  
  Transcript refers to learning from “the London accident”; confirm which incident and how it links to HK (e.g. Grenfell or other).
- **Direct to FSD structure**  
  Remind them to use **Government Directory** → full list → Fire Services Department to see full structure and identify the unit to hold accountable (e.g. Fire Investigation, Training, Operational Safety, Public Education).
- **Check**  
  That they have a short list of candidate units and draft questions for government before Week 5.

## Group 3 – eHealth

- **Lock focus by Week 5**  
  Government request goes out in Week 5; 3–7 weeks for reply (around Week 12). They need to decide focus and questions soon.
- **Two possible directions** (from transcript):
  1. **Insurance reimbursement** – How eHealth infrastructure could support claims (reduce scanning/upload, guarantee authenticity, speed reimbursement). First step: understand current technical infrastructure and feasibility.
  2. **Uptake by private sector** – Incentives or pressure so more private doctors/hospitals use/upload to eHealth; start with private hospitals if scope is an issue.
- **Human input to give**  
  - Point them to SCMP / your letters and student letters on eHealth for context.  
  - Encourage: “Understand technical infrastructure first; if it’s already supportive, then we can argue for next steps (e.g. lobbying).”  
  - Suggest international comparison: how other countries use similar systems for insurance/reimbursement.
- **Check**  
  That they choose one main focus and draft government questions before Week 5.

## Group 4 – Fire Service 2 (UK funding / Tai Po)

- **Confirm UK funding figure**  
  Transcript: “900 / 1500 / 5 billion” (British funding after “the fire”). Confirm exact figure and source (e.g. £5bn post-Grenfell or other).
- **Request from students**  
  Ask for: (1) links to the UK funding and (2) a short note on what they plan to do (e.g. cost–benefit: cost of no similar fund vs cost of one more fire).
- **Optional**  
  Suggest they put this in a file and use an AI agent/workflow to follow up (you demonstrated this in class).
- **Check**  
  That the “UK funding vs HK” comparison is clearly scoped and that they have a crisp cost–benefit angle.

## Group 5 – Prevent sexual harassment

- **Structure the ask**  
  Four units (EDB, DOJ, UGC, Security Bureau), two requests per unit. Each unit should get at least one clear recommendation; if they get “half-answers,” they can still do limited recommendations.
- **Order of work**  
  Before chasing data: (1) critical review of **current mechanisms** (existing programmes, solutions, gaps), then (2) strong argument for improvement, then (3) data requests to government.
- **Set expectations**  
  Government may not give data; staff may dodge. If no data: “drop in some emails, expect the outcome,” and use assumptions/correlation where appropriate for analysis.
- **Human input**  
  - Suggest more web search or AI/IDE search if current AI web search isn’t useful; you can do another round if they flag it.  
  - One student (CS) can try getting AI to do searches.
- **Check**  
  That they have a short critical review of current mechanisms and a clear link from “current state” → “recommendations” → “what we’re asking each department.”

## Group 6 – Rare disease

- **No specific discussion in transcript.**  
  Use existing project folder and Followup5Feb.md; add teacher actions when you next meet or when they seek feedback.

---

## Cross-cutting

- **Sync with GitHub**  
  At least one student was behind; you showed “sync with GitHub” (repository → update branch, then sync workspace). Remind any team that forked to pull/sync so their workspace matches the repo.
- **Week 5 deadline**  
  Government requests should be sent in Week 5; remind all groups that questions and focus need to be decided before then.
- **AI agents**  
  Encourage (not require) setting up a workflow/file for AI to follow up (e.g. Group 4’s UK funding follow-up, Group 5’s search). You did a demo in class.
