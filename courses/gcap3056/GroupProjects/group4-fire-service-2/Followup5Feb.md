# Follow-up Actions: Group 4 - Fire Service 2 (5 Feb 2026)

## Project Focus
Focus on fire safety education; locate the team responsible within FSD. Relate findings to Tai Po fire (Nov 2025).

## Current Status
- Research framework on fire services operations and prevention documented
- Need to connect to specific Nov 2025 incident

## Action Items

### Phase 1: Tai Po Fire (Nov 2025) Investigation
- [ ] **Research the incident** - What happened? How many affected? What were root causes?
- [ ] **Analyze media coverage** - News reports on FSD response, investigation findings, public statements
- [ ] **Identify lessons learned messaging** - Did FSD announce any policy changes or new initiatives?
- [ ] **Document education gaps** - What did the fire reveal about public/building safety awareness?

### Phase 2: Identify Fire Safety Education Units
- [ ] **Access FSD organizational chart** - https://tel.directory.gov.hk/index_FSD_ENG.html to find:
  - Fire Safety Education Section / Branch
  - Community Engagement Unit
  - School Education Program
  - Public Outreach Division
- [ ] **Map responsibilities** - Which team handles schools, public campaigns, building safety?
- [ ] **Review current programs** - What fire safety education initiatives exist now?
- [ ] **Identify gaps** - Are certain demographics/sectors underserved? (e.g., elderly, migrant workers, subdivided housing)

### Phase 3: Connect Tai Po Incident to Education Strategy
- [ ] **Analyze what happened** - Was there inadequate fire safety knowledge/preparedness?
- [ ] **Research FSD recommendations** - Did incident lead to new education campaigns?
- [ ] **Draft policy questions** - Should education be mandatory in schools? Focus on vulnerable groups?
- [ ] **Propose improvements** - Targeted education based on incident learnings
