## Suggestions for the team (follow-up)

1. **Focus:** Choose among: (a) eHealth technical infrastructure for reimbursement automation, (b) private sector adoption and data quality, (c) government role (VHIS, eHealth+, legislation).  
2. **Hypotheses:** e.g. “The government could promote eHealth as a single technical gateway for insurance reimbursement (with consent) to reduce administrative cost and delay.”  
3. **SCMP / Simon Wang:** Curate 1–2 SCMP letters on eHealth (or Simon Wang on tech/policy); cite in public-info and report.  
4. **Questions for government:** FHB on insurer access to eHealth (with consent) for claims; timeline for legislative amendments; eHealth Adoption Scheme uptake.  
5. **Google Doc & Moodle:** Update Google Doc; reply to Moodle task 4.1.
