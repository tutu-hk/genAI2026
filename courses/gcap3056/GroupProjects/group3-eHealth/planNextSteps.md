# Plan: next steps towards progress (like group6-rare-disease)

**Project:** Group 3 — eHealth (exploring how eHealth may facilitate automation of insurance reimbursement for medical bills; focus on technical infrastructure; include search for SCMP letters on eHealth including some by Simon Wang).  
**Reference:** More work has been done for `courses/gcap3056/group6-rare-disease`; see that folder’s `process.log` and files (searchPlan, AIwebsearch/AIsearchReport, hypotheses, HypotheseQuestions, etc.).

## Current state

- **Have:** `idea.md` (eHealth + insurance reimbursement automation; technical infrastructure; SCMP letters on eHealth, including by Simon Wang).
- **Gap:** No public-info summary, no search plan, no AI web search report, no written hypotheses, no formulated questions for government, no process log. Need to build from idea → curate → focus → search → hypotheses → questions.

---

## Target progress (workflow)

1. **Curate and summarise public info** — Create `public-info.md` or similar: eHealth policy in HK, insurance/reimbursement, technical infrastructure, and SCMP letters on eHealth (including by Simon Wang). Human identifies key questions; AI can search and draft summary.
2. **Choose a focus** — Decide which decisions or issues to criticise (e.g. eHealth infrastructure for reimbursement, data sharing, government’s role). Human decides; AI can draft options from docs.
3. **Search plan** — Create `searchPlan.md`: what to search (gov.hk, FHB, LegCo, SCMP site-specific for eHealth and “Simon Wang”), domains, and what to document. Human sets focus and key queries; AI can draft the plan text.
4. **AI web search + report** — Create `AIwebsearch` folder and `AIsearchReport.md`: run searches (including SCMP eHealth letters), list results with title/URL/summary, and relevance to focus. AI performs searches and drafts report; human reviews and refines.
5. **Formulate hypotheses** — Create `hypotheses.md`: one main hypothesis (to be tested) and optional alternatives; link to evidence. Human chooses focus; AI can draft from docs and report.
6. **Questions for government** — Create `HypotheseQuestions.md`: specific questions for government staff (e.g. Code on Access to Information), anticipated answers, how to use them, and what to do if little info is provided. Human approves questions; AI can draft from hypotheses + report.
7. **Process log** — Create/update `process.log` in this folder: what was done, what will be done, real-time log. Human or AI can update as you go.

## When to get help from AI (and for what)

- **Drafting text:** public-info summary, searchPlan.md, hypotheses.md, HypotheseQuestions.md.
- **Running searches:** Web search (e.g. site:scmp.com eHealth Simon Wang; gov.hk eHealth; insurance reimbursement; technical infrastructure).
- **Structuring:** Turning a list of findings into hypotheses; turning hypotheses into clear, answerable questions.
- **Anticipating answers:** Suggesting possible government replies and how each would help the project.
- **Not for:** Final choice of focus (human); approval of questions to send (human); verification of facts and URLs (human).

## What human input is essential

- **Choosing focus:** Which aspect of eHealth / reimbursement / infrastructure to prioritise, which hypothesis to lead with.
- **Setting search scope:** Which topics, which domains (e.g. FHB, LegCo, SCMP), and specifically SCMP letters on eHealth and by Simon Wang.
- **Reviewing AI output:** Checking search results for relevance and accuracy; editing hypotheses and questions so they match the team’s intent and the course rubric.
- **Deciding what to send:** Which questions to send to which bureau/department and under what channel (e.g. Code on Access to Information).
- **Updating the process log:** At least confirming or correcting what’s recorded as done and next.

## How human and AI work together

- **Human leads:** Define the focus and the goal (e.g. “we want to ask the government about eHealth infrastructure for reimbursement and cite SCMP letters”).
- **AI assists:** Proposes search queries (including SCMP + Simon Wang), drafts searchPlan, runs searches, drafts report, drafts hypotheses and questions; human reviews and edits each step.
- **Iterate:** If search results are weak, human suggests new queries or domains; AI runs again and updates the report.
- **Document:** Use `process.log` to record who did what (human vs AI) and what’s next, so the team and teacher can see progress (see group6’s `process.log`).
