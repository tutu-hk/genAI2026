# Follow-up Actions: Group 3 - eHealth (5 Feb 2026)

## Project Focus
Explore how eHealth technical infrastructure may facilitate the automation of reimbursement for health insurance companies.

## Current Status
- Project recently transitioned from Government Vacancies to eHealth
- Focus areas identified: eHealth policy, technical infrastructure, insurance reimbursement, SCMP letters
- Ready to begin curating public information

## Action Items

### Phase 1: eHealth Infrastructure Research
- [ ] **Study HK eHealth ecosystem** - Current systems, APIs, data exchange protocols
- [ ] **Research insurance reimbursement workflows** - How do insurers currently process medical claims?
- [ ] **Identify integration points** - Which eHealth components could automate reimbursement?
- [ ] **Document technical standards** - HL7, FHIR, or HK-specific medical data standards

### Phase 2: Public Information Curation
- [ ] **SCMP articles on eHealth** - Locate and analyze letters/articles by Simon Wang and others
- [ ] **Government eHealth strategy** - Review DH eHealth Master Plan, pilot projects, announcements
- [ ] **Insurance industry statements** - How do insurers comment on digitalization?
- [ ] **Create curated `public-info.md`** - Organize by policy, standards, industry players

### Phase 3: Develop Search & Analysis Plan
- [ ] **Create `searchPlan.md`** - Define key search terms, sources, stakeholders to contact
- [ ] **Research international examples** - How do other jurisdictions automate medical reimbursement? (US, SG, EU)
- [ ] **Identify hypotheses** - E.g., "Blockchain for claims", "Real-time data exchange", "HL7 integration"
- [ ] **Draft government questions** - What are barriers? Privacy concerns? Timeline for standardization?
