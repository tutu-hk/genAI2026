# Plan: next steps towards progress (like group6-rare-disease)

**Project:** Group 3 — Government Vacancies App (analysis and improvement proposals for job seekers).  
**Reference:** More work has been done for `courses/gcap3056/group6-rare-disease`; see that folder’s `process.log` and files (searchPlan, AIwebsearch/AIsearchReport, hypotheses, HypotheseQuestions, etc.).

---

## Current state

- **Have:** `public-info.md` (overview, app details, Google Doc link), `openDataAccess.md`, `prelimReport.md`.
- **Gap:** No search plan, no AI web search report, no written hypotheses, no formulated questions for government, no process log. Need to move towards focus → search → hypotheses → questions.

---

## Target progress (workflow)

1. **Curate and summarise public info** — Ensure `public-info.md` and/or a short summary capture what the team has found and what’s missing or dated; link prelimReport if it’s the current summary.
2. **Choose a focus** — Decide which decisions or issues to criticise (e.g. app UX, accessibility, data export, CSB’s review process). Human decides; AI can draft options from docs.
3. **Search plan** — Create `searchPlan.md`: what to search (gov.hk, CSB, LegCo, SCMP, app stores, etc.), domains, and what to document. Human sets focus and key queries; AI can draft the plan text.
4. **AI web search + report** — Create `AIwebsearch` folder and `AIsearchReport.md`: run searches, list results with title/URL/summary, and relevance to focus. AI performs searches and drafts report; human reviews and refines.
5. **Formulate hypotheses** — Create `hypotheses.md`: one main hypothesis (to be tested) and optional alternatives; link to evidence. Human chooses focus; AI can draft from docs and report.
6. **Questions for government** — Create `HypotheseQuestions.md`: specific questions for government staff (e.g. Code on Access to Information to CSB), anticipated answers, how to use them, and what to do if little info is provided. Human approves questions; AI can draft from hypotheses + report.
7. **Process log** — Create/update `process.log` in this folder: what was done, what will be done, real-time log. Human or AI can update as you go.

## When to get help from AI (and for what)

- **Drafting text:** searchPlan.md, hypotheses.md, HypotheseQuestions.md, summary from public-info/prelimReport.
- **Running searches:** Web search (site-specific and general) on gov.hk, CSB, LegCo, SCMP, Government Vacancies app, civil service recruitment.
- **Structuring:** Turning a list of findings into hypotheses; turning hypotheses into clear, answerable questions.
- **Anticipating answers:** Suggesting possible government replies and how each would help the project.
- **Not for:** Final choice of focus (human); approval of questions to send (human); verification of facts and URLs (human).

## What human input is essential

- **Choosing focus:** Which aspects of the app or CSB process to criticise, which hypothesis to lead with.
- **Setting search scope:** Which topics, which domains (e.g. CSB, LegCo, user reviews), which time range.
- **Reviewing AI output:** Checking search results for relevance and accuracy; editing hypotheses and questions so they match the team’s intent and the course rubric.
- **Deciding what to send:** Which questions to send to which bureau/department (e.g. CSB) and under what channel (e.g. Code on Access to Information).
- **Updating the process log:** At least confirming or correcting what’s recorded as done and next.

## How human and AI work together

- **Human leads:** Define the focus and the goal (e.g. “we want to ask CSB about [X] and propose improvements to the app”).
- **AI assists:** Proposes search queries, drafts searchPlan, runs searches, drafts report, drafts hypotheses and questions; human reviews and edits each step.
- **Iterate:** If search results are weak, human suggests new queries or domains; AI runs again and updates the report.
- **Document:** Use `process.log` to record who did what (human vs AI) and what’s next, so the team and teacher can see progress (see group6’s `process.log`).
