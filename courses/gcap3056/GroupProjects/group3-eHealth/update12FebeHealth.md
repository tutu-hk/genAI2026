# eHealth Update — 12 February 2026

## Key Questions Addressed

### 1. Has the eHealth Amendment Bill Been Passed?

**Yes.** The Electronic Health Record Sharing System (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 was passed by LegCo and came into effect on **1 December 2025**.

- The Bill had its First Reading on 26 March 2025
- A Bills Committee scrutinised it and supported the amendments
- The Committee noted the enhanced eHealth infrastructure supports healthcare reform, including primary healthcare and cross-boundary services

### 2. What Counts as "Important Patient Data"?

The amendment does not provide a single rigid definition, but characterises "important health data" by **clinical necessity** — data that is:

- Essential in supporting **diagnosis**
- Effective in **preventing medical errors**
- Useful in avoiding **contradictory or duplicated medical treatments**

**Priority data categories** for mandatory deposit:
- Allergies and adverse drug reactions
- Prescriptions
- Laboratory and radiology reports
- Immunisation records

The specific data categories and which healthcare providers are subject to deposit requirements will be formally designated after consultation with industry and stakeholders.

Beyond the mandatory categories, eHealth's broader sharable data scope also includes: personal identification, diagnosis/procedures/medication, clinical notes, birth records, healthcare referrals, and medical certificates.

### 3. Government Attempts or Plans to Enforce the Law

The government has introduced **two key schemes** to support and enforce adoption:

**eHealth+ Connectivity Support Scheme** (launched October 2025):
- Subsidy of **HK$500/month per registered medical practitioner**, up to 12 months (max HK$6,000)
- For western medical practices using accredited Electronic Medical Record Systems (EMRS)
- Application deadline: 31 March 2026

**eHealth+ Connectivity Accreditation Scheme:**
- Gold, silver, and bronze accreditation marks to identify eHealth-connected providers
- Helps patients identify which providers actively participate

**Penalty mechanism:**
- Healthcare providers who repeatedly fail to comply with a data-deposit order face fines of up to **HK$50,000**
- The Secretary for Health is empowered to require specified HCPs to deposit specified health data

### 4. Will the Government Only Investigate When Receiving a Complaint from a Patient?

The published materials do **not specify** the exact complaint or investigation mechanism. Key observations:

- The legislation empowers the **Secretary for Health** to designate which providers must upload data — this is a proactive regulatory power, not purely reactive
- The penalty applies when providers "**repeatedly** ignore" a data-input order, suggesting some ongoing monitoring or compliance process
- However, **no detailed enforcement or inspection framework** has been publicly described (e.g., routine audits vs. complaint-driven investigation)
- **This is a gap worth investigating** — a question for government enquiry (see GovEnquiries.md)

### 5. How Is the Current Policy Different from a Mandatory Requirement of Uploading Patient Records?

The amendment creates a **hybrid mandatory/voluntary system**, not a fully mandatory one:

| Aspect | Before Amendment | After Amendment (Dec 2025) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Patient joining | Voluntary | Still voluntary — patients must give "joining consent" |
| Data deposit by HCPs | Voluntary | Secretary for Health **can require** specified HCPs to deposit specified data |
| Patient opt-out | N/A | Patients who have joined can still **request providers not to submit** their data |
| Sharing consent (access) | Required from each provider | Still required — patients grant/revoke access at any time |
| Penalty for non-compliance | None | Up to HK$50,000 for repeated non-compliance |

**Key distinction:** The mandatory element targets the **provider side** (forcing doctors to upload), not the patient side (patients can still choose not to join or can opt out). This is different from a blanket mandatory upload requirement because:
- Only "specified" HCPs and "specified" data types are covered
- Patient consent to join eHealth is still required
- Patients retain the right to ask providers not to deposit their data

## Additional Context: SCMP Letter (Dec 2020) — eHealth Underuse

From a 2020 SCMP letter (https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/3114920):
- By 2019, eHRSS was accessed ~656,140 times, including 436,180 by 13,520 doctors
- Average: each doctor used eHRSS only ~32 times/year
- 80%+ of registered HCPs were from public hospitals
- Private practitioners faced cumbersome paper-based registration
- Called for: simplified online registration, mandatory use for Health Care Voucher Scheme participants
- This letter foreshadowed the problems the 2025 amendment now tries to address
