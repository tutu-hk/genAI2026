# Government Enquiries — eHealth Group (Group 3)

## Context

The Electronic Health Record Sharing System (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 came into effect on 1 December 2025. While the legislation introduces new powers for the Secretary for Health to mandate data deposits by specified healthcare providers, several important details remain unclear and warrant formal enquiry.

The SCMP letter of December 2020 already raised concerns about low usage — on average, each doctor used eHRSS only 32 times in 2019, and 80%+ of registrants were from public hospitals. The 2025 amendment attempts to address this, but key questions remain.

## Questions for the Health Bureau (under Code on Access to Information)

### A. Enforcement and Compliance

1. **What enforcement mechanism is in place to ensure healthcare providers comply with data-deposit orders?**
   - Is there a routine audit or inspection system, or does the government only investigate upon receiving a complaint?
   - How many inspectors or compliance officers are assigned to monitor eHealth data-deposit compliance?

2. **What constitutes "repeatedly" ignoring a data-input order (triggering the HK$50,000 fine)?**
   - How many instances of non-compliance are needed before a fine is imposed?
   - Is there a formal warning process before penalties?

3. **Has any healthcare provider been penalised or warned under the new amendment since 1 December 2025?**
   - If not, what is the expected timeline for enforcement actions?

### B. Data Definition and Scope

4. **What is the precise list of "specified health data" that healthcare providers are currently required to deposit?**
   - Has the Secretary for Health formally designated specific data types and HCP categories?
   - If not, when is this expected?

5. **How does the government determine which healthcare providers are "specified" and subject to mandatory data deposit?**
   - What criteria or thresholds are used (e.g., practice size, patient volume, speciality)?

### C. Patient Rights and Privacy

6. **How can a patient exercise the right to request that a provider not deposit their data, even after joining eHealth?**
   - Is there a formal mechanism (e.g., an opt-out form)?
   - How is this communicated to patients?

7. **What safeguards are in place to prevent unauthorised access to patient data by healthcare providers, particularly cross-boundary providers?**
   - How does the government verify and monitor "recognised" HCPs outside Hong Kong?

### D. Subsidy and Adoption

8. **How many private healthcare providers have applied for the eHealth+ Connectivity Support Scheme since its launch in October 2025?**
   - What is the approval rate?
   - What percentage of eligible providers have applied?

9. **What is the current uptake of the eHealth+ Connectivity Accreditation Scheme?**
   - How many providers have achieved gold, silver, or bronze accreditation?

10. **What concrete steps is the government taking to increase private-sector data deposits beyond the current <1%?**
    - Is the subsidy of HK$500/month considered sufficient to incentivise adoption?
    - Are additional legislative or financial measures planned?

### E. eHealth and Insurance Integration

11. **Has the Health Bureau considered extending eHealth functionality to support automated insurance reimbursement (e.g., VHIS claims)?**
    - If yes, what progress has been made?
    - If no, what technical or regulatory barriers have been identified?

12. **Has any feasibility study been conducted on integrating eHealth with the insurance industry?**
    - What is the current number of eHealth users with linked insurance data?

### F. Cross-Boundary Services

13. **How many healthcare providers outside Hong Kong have been "recognised" under the new cross-boundary provisions?**
    - Which jurisdictions are covered?
    - How is data security maintained for cross-boundary records?

### G. System Effectiveness

14. **Since the amendment took effect (1 December 2025), what has been the change in private-sector data-deposit rates?**
    - Can the government provide monthly statistics comparing before and after the amendment?

15. **What is the government's target for private-sector data-deposit rates by end of 2026?**
    - What milestones or KPIs are being used to measure success?

## Questions Arising from the 2020 SCMP Letter

The 2020 letter (https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/3114920) raised issues that may still be relevant:

16. **Has the government simplified the registration process for private healthcare professionals?**
    - Is online registration now available (the letter called for this in 2020)?
    - Is registration now required for all providers in the Health Care Voucher Scheme?

17. **What are the current eHRSS access statistics?**
    - How do 2025/2026 figures compare with 2019 (656,140 accesses, ~32 per doctor)?
    - Has the amendment measurably increased usage?

## Suggested Follow-Up Actions

- Submit formal enquiry under the **Code on Access to Information** to the Health Bureau
- If responses are unsatisfactory, consider filing a complaint through the **LegCo Redress System**
- Draft a letter to the editor (SCMP) highlighting the enforcement gap and low private-sector compliance
- Monitor the eHealth+ schemes and request periodic updates on adoption statistics
