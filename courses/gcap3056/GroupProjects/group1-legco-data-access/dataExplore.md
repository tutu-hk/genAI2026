fetch info from the links and explore how data is kept in the websites 
go deeper and visit links and links found in the pages 
try to get the overall structure of the pages and retrieve metadata and find out what data is available 

create a dataReport.md to document what you find out and explore how we might answer the question How different info sources on Legco discussion and matters are connected? 

we want to understand the current practices of curating info and data and consider how they can be improved for the general public
