# Follow-up Actions: Group 1 - Legco Data Access (5 Feb 2026)

## Project Focus
Find a specific and relevant use case: How ordinary members of the public may benefit from Legco data as a case study on accessibility.

## Current Status
- Extensive media coverage on rare diseases (SMA) documented
- Legco Q&A from govt already identified  
- Public awareness campaigns on insurance/drug subsidies

---

## Action Items

### Phase 1: Define the Use Case
- [ ] **Research Legco's data liberation efforts** - What datasets are publicly available? Legco Open Data platform, XML, API?
- [ ] **Map policy gap** - Which Legco debates/questions relate to rare disease healthcare access?
- [ ] **Identify the "ordinary member of public"** - Who would benefit? (patients, caregivers, advocates, researchers?)
- [ ] **Document & analyze current barriers** - How could Legco data be used better?

### Phase 2: Build the Case Study
- [ ] **Extract specific data patterns** from Legco records (speeches, voting records, inquiries on healthcare)
- [ ] **Create simple visual** or mapping showing how Legco data could inform patient advocacy
- [ ] **Interview or contact stakeholders** - reach out to SMA patient groups, Legco research team

### Phase 3: Develop Recommendations
- [ ] **Draft accessibility recommendations** - Data formats, platforms, documentation
- [ ] **Propose a pilot** - E.g., "Legco Healthcare Dashboard" or simple searchable index

## How AI Agents Can Help

✅ **Web Search & Content Aggregation**
- Search for Legco open data initiatives, API documentation, accessibility standards
- Summarize Legco debates on healthcare topics (rare disease, insurance, drug pricing)

✅ **Data Analysis & Pattern Recognition**
- Analyze Legco speeches and voting patterns to identify key healthcare policy trends
- Extract relevant dates, stakeholders, policy shifts

✅ **Research & Contextualization**
- Compare HK Legco accessibility vs. other parliamentary open data initiatives (Singapore, Taiwan)
- Research best practices for government data democratization

✅ **Document Creation**
- Generate research summaries, data request templates, briefing documents
- Draft recommendations for accessibility improvements

## Next Meeting Prep
- Share current findings on Legco data availability
- Discuss which healthcare policy area to focus on (SMA, drug pricing, insurance automation?)
- Confirm target audience for the use case
