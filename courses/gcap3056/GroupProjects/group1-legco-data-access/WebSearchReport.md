## Suggestions for the team (follow-up)

1. **Focus:** Choose among: (a) LegCo API usability and documentation, (b) HA/data.gov.hk vs LegCo data linkage, (c) healthcare reform and data availability.  
2. **Hypotheses:** e.g. “Improving LegCo and HA open data (APIs, formats) would strengthen healthcare policy analysis and public scrutiny.”  
3. **Questions for government:** Code on Access to Information or LegCo: request list of healthcare datasets on DATA.GOV.HK; HA data-sharing criteria; LegCo research brief publication schedule.  
4. **Google Doc & Moodle:** Update team Google Doc; reply to Moodle task 4.1.
