## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Restrictive Age Limits for Drug Subsidies
- Age limit of 25 for subsidizing medications like Nusinersen and Risdiplam
- Creates a "lost generation" of patients who age out of support
- Mainland China has no such age limits

### 2. High Drug Costs
- Drug costs in Hong Kong reportedly up to 20 times higher than in mainland hospitals
- Government reluctance to explore regional bulk purchasing

### 3. Fragmented Long-Term Care
- Heavy reliance on charitable trusts (e.g., Families of SMA Charitable Trust) for essential equipment
- Risks during machinery breakdowns for life-sustaining equipment

### 4. Data Gaps
- Lack of comprehensive statistics on rare diseases
- Impedes evidence-based policymaking

## Background: Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)

**What is SMA?**
- Hereditary disease caused by defects in the SMN1 gene
- Leads to progressive muscle weakness through loss of motor neurons
- Classified into Types 1-4 based on severity and age of onset

| Type | Age of Onset | Description | Life Expectancy |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Type 1 | Before 6 months | Most severe; cannot sit or stand | ~2 years without treatment |
| Type 2 | 6-18 months | Can sit but cannot walk | Reduced, most reach adulthood |
| Type 3 | After 18 months | Can walk independently | Normal |
| Type 4 | Adult onset | Mild weakness | Normal |

**Treatment Options:**
- Disease-modifying drugs: Nusinersen (Spinraza), Risdiplam (Evrysdi)
- Best outcomes when treatment started early (pre-symptomatic)
- Multi-disciplinary care: physiotherapy, rehabilitation, respiratory support

## Key Questions for Investigation

1. How does the government balance clinical evidence requirements with urgent patient needs?
2. What metrics define "cost-effectiveness" for ultra-expensive drugs?
3. Why does the government lack comprehensive rare disease statistics?
4. What barriers prevent joining mainland bulk drug procurement?
5. How can Hong Kong develop formalized long-term care frameworks?
