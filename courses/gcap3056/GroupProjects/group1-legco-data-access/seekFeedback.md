# Seek feedback from the team

**Project:** Group 1 — LegCo Data Access

---

## What we need from you

1. **Update your Google Doc** with any new findings, focus choices, or hypotheses so the teacher and AI can align with your direction.
2. **Reply to Moodle task 4.1** when ready, so the teacher can see your progress and discuss next steps (including hypotheses and how the government can improve its work).

## Teacher’s notes (Google Doc)

The teacher will update notes and discuss hypotheses with each group. Please check and contribute here:

**Google Doc (teacher notes):** [Open document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GCsy8H3-49Z8JgxrxmhFEQDDqKoNTiLQyNfczot1Kd0/edit?tab=t.omet00l6dw0c#heading=h.ee8yny75hqnd)

*After the teacher discusses hypotheses with your group, the AI agent can conduct more targeted web searches to support your project.*
