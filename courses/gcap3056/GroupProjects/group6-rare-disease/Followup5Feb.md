# Follow-up Actions: Group 6 - Rare Disease (5 Feb 2026)

## Project Focus
Learn more about different jurisdictions and regimes on drug pricing between HK and Mainland, and analyze implications.

## Current Status
- Extensive media coverage on SMA treatment access documented
- Key policy data on drug subsidies and age limits identified
- Some cost references (HK drugs 20x more expensive than Mainland)
- Ready to deepen comparative analysis

## Action Items

### Phase 1: Research Drug Pricing Regimes

#### Hong Kong System
- [ ] **HKSAR approval process** - Registration timeline, pricing authority
- [ ] **Health Authority (HA) subsidies** - Which drugs? Age limits? Cost thresholds?
- [ ] **Pricing mechanisms** - How are subsidized drug prices set?
- [ ] **Self-pay pathway** - How do patients access non-subsidized drugs? Costs?
- [ ] **Regulatory bodies** - Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA equivalent)

#### Mainland China System
- [ ] **NMPA approval process** - How fast vs. HK?
- [ ] **NHIS (National Health Insurance Scheme) coverage** - Which rare disease drugs?
- [ ] **Provincial variation** - Do prices/coverage differ by province?
- [ ] **Recent reforms** - Bulk purchasing, centralized pricing initiative
- [ ] **Cross-border access** - Rules on importing Mainland drugs to HK

#### Other Jurisdictions (Comparative)
- [ ] **Singapore** - Rare disease drug pricing and access
- [ ] **Taiwan** - NHIA pricing and patient access models
- [ ] **UK/EU** - NICE appraisal process, patient access schemes
- [ ] **USA** - Orphan drug program, pricing pressures

### Phase 2: Analyze Cost & Implications
- [ ] **Quantify price gaps** - Specific drugs, specific cost differentials
- [ ] **Understand drivers** - Regulation, market size, manufacturing, negotiation power
- [ ] **Patient access patterns** - Do HK patients travel to Mainland for treatment? Risks?
- [ ] **Insurance implications** - Can patients claim coverage for Mainland-purchased drugs?
- [ ] **Health equity** - Who can afford access? Vulnerable populations?

### Phase 3: Policy Recommendations
- [ ] **Identify policy options** - Regulatory harmonization? Regional bulk purchasing? Reference pricing?
- [ ] **Draft government questions** - Specific inquiries on barriers to faster approval, price negotiation
- [ ] **Document stakeholder positions** - Pharma companies, patient groups, medical professionals
- [ ] **Propose solutions** - How to improve access without burdening healthcare system?

## How AI Agents Can Help

✅ **Comparative Policy Research**
- Research drug approval timelines and costs in HK vs. Mainland vs. other jurisdictions
- Compile regulatory requirements for rare disease drug registration
- Analyze recent drug pricing reforms in China (centralized procurement, volume-based discounts)

✅ **Data Analysis & Visualization**
- Create comparative cost matrices for specific rare disease drugs
- Map pricing mechanisms and patient access pathways in different jurisdictions
- Analyze trends in drug pricing and approval speed over time

✅ **News & Research Aggregation**
- Search for recent articles on drug access barriers for rare diseases in HK
- Find Mainland healthcare policy announcements on drug coverage
- Research patient advocacy groups' policy proposals

✅ **Document & Analysis Creation**
- Generate briefing on comparative drug pricing regimes
- Draft hypotheses on why HK drugs cost more (regulatory, market, negotiation factors)
- Create government inquiry questions with specific data points
- Prepare recommendations for policy alignment or patient access improvements

## Key Questions to Answer
1. What are the actual price differentials? (Need: specific drug examples with HK vs. Mainland prices)
2. Why does HK charge more? (Regulation? Market size? Negotiation power?)
3. What are legal barriers to cross-border access?
4. How do other jurisdictions handle rare disease affordability?

## Next Meeting Prep
- Share findings on specific rare disease drugs and their pricing in different markets
- Discuss whether focus should be on policy reform OR patient access strategies
- Review comparative framework (which jurisdictions to compare?)
