# Task 3.1: Step-by-Step Instructions for Rare Disease Project

**For: Solo Student (Group 6 - Rare Disease)**  
**Deadline: First reply in Week 3 (29 Jan); Update by Week 5**

---

## What You Need to Do (Summary)

You need to:
1. Learn how to use Google site-specific search
2. Find information about rare disease policy on government websites
3. Post your findings on Moodle

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### STEP 1: Open Google

Go to: **https://www.google.com**

---

### STEP 2: Type a Site-Specific Search

In the search box, type EXACTLY this:

```
site:gov.hk rare disease
```

Alternatively, you can use: `"rare disease" site:gov.hk` (with quotes around the search terms).

**Important:** 
- There is NO space between `site:` and `gov.hk`
- There IS a space between `gov.hk` and `rare disease`

Then press Enter.

---

### STEP 3: Look at the Results

You will see results ONLY from gov.hk websites. This is useful because:
- These are official government sources
- The information is reliable
- You can quote these in your project

---

### STEP 4: Try More Searches

Copy and paste these searches one at a time:

| Search to Try | What You Will Find |
|---------------|-------------------|
| `site:ha.org.hk rare disease` | Hospital Authority information |
| `site:legco.gov.hk rare disease` | LegCo questions and debates |
| `site:info.gov.hk rare disease` | Government press releases |
| `site:gov.hk SMA drug` | Info about Spinal Muscular Atrophy drugs |
| `site:gov.hk nusinersen` | Info about the specific SMA drug |

---

### STEP 5: Record Your Findings

For EACH search you do, write down:

| What to Record | Your Answer |
|----------------|-------------|
| What search did you type? | Example: `site:ha.org.hk rare disease` |
| How many results did you get? | Example: About 1,500 results |
| What was the most useful link? | Example: HA Drug Formulary page |
| Copy the URL | Example: https://www.ha.org.hk/... |
| What fact did you learn? | Example: HA has a list of 35 rare diseases |

Hi everyone,

I tried Google site-specific search for my rare disease project.

**Search 1:**
- I searched: site:legco.gov.hk rare disease drug
- I found: About 2,400 results
- The most useful link was: https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202406/12/P2024061200662p.htm
- I learned: In June 2024, LegCo asked about rare disease drug support. The government said HA has databases for 35 rare diseases and will expand to 207.

**Search 2:**
- I searched: site:gov.hk nusinersen SMA
- I found: About 150 results
- The most useful link was: https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr18-19/english/panels/hs/papers/hs20181217cb2-449-3-e.pdf
- I learned: Nusinersen (Spinraza) costs about $1 million HKD for the first year of treatment.

**Reflection:**
This search technique is useful because it only shows official government sources, so I know the information is reliable. For my rare disease project, I can use this to find LegCo debates and HA policies about drug subsidies.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "I get no results"
**Solution:** Check your spelling. Make sure there's no space between `site:` and the domain.

### Problem: "I don't understand the results"
**Solution:** Click on the links and read the pages. Look for PDFs - they often have detailed information.

### Problem: "The page is in Chinese"
**Solution:** Look for an English version link, or use Google Translate.
