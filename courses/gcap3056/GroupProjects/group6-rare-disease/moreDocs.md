### 1. LCQ16: Support for patients with rare diseases

**[LCQ16: Support for patients with rare diseases](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202406/12/P2024061200662.htm)**  
[in summary2Feb]

Written reply by Secretary for Health (Prof Lo Chung-mau) to Hon Tang Ka-piu (12 Jun 2024). Covers: HA rare/uncommon disorder databases (35 now, 207 planned); CCF Ultra-expensive Drugs Programme and subsidy figures (e.g. Nusinersen 80 applications, HK$183.54m; Risdiplam 47, HK$74.19m); age limit for SMA drug subsidies (no subsidy for adults over 25); "1+" drug registration; GBA healthcare cooperation; Government does not encourage HA to procure drugs directly from the Mainland; HA bargaining power and centralised procurement; differences in registration and pricing between HK and Mainland.

**Excerpt (reply on Mainland procurement):**  
*"The differences in registration systems, pricing mechanisms for pharmaceutical manufacturers, and customs mechanisms of drugs between Hong Kong and the Mainland imply that drug procurement procedures of the two places are not entirely compatible. Consequently, direct comparisons between the relevant arrangements cannot be made. As previously stated, it is important to ensure that the inherent strengths of Hong Kong's drug regulatory regime are not compromised when considering the HA's drug procurement strategy."*

**Excerpt (question cited):**  
*"Some patients with rare diseases have opted to buy drugs from hospitals in the Mainland, where the prices are only 5 per cent of those at local public hospitals."* — and *"whether the Government will encourage the HA to purchase drugs directly from the Mainland or join the Mainland's drug procurement mechanism"*.

## Summary of themes (for hypotheses.md)

- **GovHK stance on Mainland procurement:** LCQ16 reply states the Government does not encourage HA to procure drugs directly from the Mainland or join the Mainland's procurement mechanism; stresses "one country, two systems", independent drug regulatory regime, and quality/safety.
- **Price gap:** Multiple sources report Mainland drug prices far lower (e.g. ~5% of HK public hospital prices; cancer drug <1/5; "10 times cheaper" for some services).
- **HK–Mainland cooperation:** GBA pilot (e.g. HKU-Shenzhen follow-ups), planned HK–Shenzhen research centre for real-world data to fast-track Mainland approval (not HK buying from Mainland). No policy to "encourage" rare disease patients to go north for drugs; focus is "additional choice" for those living in GBA.
- **SMA-specific:** Age limit (no subsidy for adults >25 for Nusinersen/Risdiplam); CCF subsidy figures in LCQ16; Mainland NHSA negotiated large Nusinersen price cut and insurance listing.
- **"1+" and reform:** Extended to all new drugs (Nov 2024); first advanced therapy product under "1+" (Nov 2025); roadmap to primary evaluation and Centre for Medical Products Regulation.
