Review the texts and docs here.

consider genAI2026/gcap3056/CourseInfo/week4Look4focus.md 

perform another round of search online focusing on gov.hk and scmp.com and other sites and general search as well 

create moreDocs.md and present titles, URLs and summaries 

then create a hypotheses.md to propose some hypotheses that may guide us to move forward 

one thing we are interested in is how HK gov may engage the Mainland to get cheaper drugs
