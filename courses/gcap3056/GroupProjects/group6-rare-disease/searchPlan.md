follow courses/gcap3056/CourseInfo/Assessment/AIresponseGuideline.md when generate responses

consider the project context courses/gcap3056/group6-rare-disease

the team has found quite a bit of info courses/gcap3056/group6-rare-disease/summary2Feb.md 

but many docs are a bit old (dated) 

we need to perform web search to locate more info about rare disease care in Hong Kong 

domain could be gov.hk, SCMP.com, major media outlet and the Internet 

create AIwebsearch folder under courses/gcap3056/group6-rare-disease

**generate an AIsearchReport.md** 

document what specific web searches have been performed, keywords, domain - site specific or general; what tools used, other useful metrics 

then list pages found, title, URL and summaries (not in table) 

for each item describe how it is relevant to the project especially in relation to the following focus 

## Potential focus (current lead)

### Mainland procurement vs independent drug regime

**Finding from docs:**
The Government does not encourage the Hospital Authority (HA) to procure drugs directly from the Mainland or to join the Mainland’s drug procurement mechanism. It emphasises an independent drug regulatory regime, quality and safety, and “one country, two systems.” Cooperation with the Mainland is framed as **GBA convenience** (e.g. HKU–Shenzhen follow-ups) and a future HK–Shenzhen centre using HK real-world data to **speed up Mainland approval** of drugs—not as HA buying Mainland drugs for use in Hong Kong.

**Why it might be a good focus:**

- Directly addresses the team interest: *how might the HK government engage the Mainland to get cheaper drugs for patients (e.g. rare disease / SMA)?*
- There is a clear, criticisable **policy choice**: prioritising regulatory independence over exploring procurement cooperation, while patients (and LegCo) report Mainland drug prices at a fraction of HK (e.g. ~5% of HK public hospital prices; cancer drugs &lt;1/5).
- We can ask whether the current stance is **necessary as stated** (e.g. whether quality/safety could be assured under defined cooperation) or whether there is room to explore **targeted** engagement (e.g. specific drug categories, joint procurement studies) without giving up “primary evaluation” or international recognition.

**Hypothesis (to be tested):**
*The Government could explore forms of engagement with the Mainland (e.g. joint procurement pilots, reference to Mainland pricing in negotiations, or conditional procurement for certain ultra-expensive drugs) that preserve quality and regulatory standards while improving affordability for rare disease and other high-cost drugs.*

**Evidence we have:**

- LCQ16 reply (Jun 2024): explicit “do not encourage” HA to procure from Mainland or join Mainland mechanism; emphasis on regime differences and HA’s existing bargaining power.
- SCMP / other: Mainland Nusinersen price cut (NHSA negotiation); HK patients going north for cheaper drugs; LegCo question citing ~5% Mainland vs HK prices.
- moreDocs.md #1, #2, #9, #12, #13, #17.

**Evidence we may need:**

- Whether any other jurisdiction with an “independent” regime has allowed conditional procurement from a neighbouring market; whether HA has ever assessed feasibility of joint or reference-price cooperation with Mainland for specific drugs; official reasoning (if any) beyond the published reply.

## Other options (alternative foci)

We can switch focus or add a second strand. Other plausible hypotheses from the same docs:
