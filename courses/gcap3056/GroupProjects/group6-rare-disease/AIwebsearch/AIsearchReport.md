## 2. Pages found: title, URL, summary, relevance

**Item 1**  
**Title:** LCQ5: Providing treatment for patients experiencing relapses or deterioration of rare diseases  
**URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000562.htm  
**Summary:** Govt reply (Sep 2025) on HA rare disease support. HA has a Rare Diseases Database referencing Mainland’s national lists (207 entities); CMS records ~63,600 cases. Covers use of the database for diagnosis/treatment, emergency support for relapses, and possible multi-specialty expert panels for high-relapse conditions (e.g. neuromyelitis optica).  
**Relevance:** Shows HA’s use of Mainland *lists* (disease definitions) but not procurement. Supports “independent regime” narrative (HK database, HK clinical data). Useful for contrast: HK adopts Mainland *classification* but not Mainland *procurement*.

**Item 2**  
**Title:** LCQ16: Support for patients with rare diseases  
**URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202406/12/P2024061200662.htm  
**Summary:** Jun 2024 LegCo reply. HA databases for 35 then expanding to 207 uncommon disorders; “1+” mechanism for new drug registration from Nov 2023; some patients buy drugs from Mainland at ~5% of HK prices; age limit (25) for SMA drug subsidies questioned.  
**Relevance:** **Core evidence** for Mainland procurement focus: explicit “do not encourage” HA to procure from Mainland; “1+” and age limit (option B) also referenced. Use for hypotheses and for drafting questions to government.

**Item 3**  
**Title:** LCQ22: Hospital Authority's drug procurement and prescription  
**URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202411/13/P2024111300553.htm  
**Summary:** Nov 2024 LegCo Q&A on HA drug procurement: expenditure by category (general, anti-coronavirus, cancer, rare disease, special drugs), and policies on drug selection, safety and efficacy.  
**Relevance:** Official description of how HA procures and selects drugs (including rare disease). Complements LCQ16: shows current procurement framework without Mainland; useful for asking whether HA has ever assessed joint/reference-price cooperation with Mainland.

**Item 4**  
**Title:** LCQ8: Introduction of drugs for use in Hong Kong  
**URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202412/11/P2024121100452.htm  
**Summary:** Dec 2024 reply on introducing new drugs (including oncology) from Mainland: Named Patient Programme (NPP), challenges (cumbersome procedures, long approval, full prepayment), GMP certification, PIC/S.  
**Relevance:** Directly on *introduction* of Mainland drugs into HK (registration/NPP, not HA procurement). Supports focus: current pathway is individual/NPP, not bulk HA procurement from Mainland; good for questions on whether government has considered pilot procurement or reference pricing with Mainland.

**Item 5**  
**Title:** First batch of new drugs approved by "1+" mechanism listed on HA Drug Formulary  
**URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202407/26/P2024072600352.htm  
**Summary:** Jul 2024: first “1+”-approved drugs added to HA formulary (faster registration with one reference country).  
**Relevance:** “1+” speeds up *registration* in HK; does not address *procurement* from Mainland. Supports option C (speed of access). Contrast with focus: government promotes “1+” as solution but does not encourage HA to buy from Mainland even when Mainland prices are far lower.

**Item 6**  
**Title:** Drug Office - Frequently Asked Questions (1+ mechanism)  
**URL:** https://www.drugoffice.gov.hk/eps/do/en/pharmaceutical_trade/onePlus_faq.html  
**Summary:** Official FAQ: “1+” from 1 Nov 2023; one reference country; expanded Nov 2024 to all new drugs with prominent clinical benefit; 150 working days target; orphan/breakthrough evidence; local or Chinese/Asian data.  
**Relevance:** Authoritative detail on “1+” for report. Helps argue that regulatory *innovation* (1+) exists but procurement *cooperation* with Mainland is not pursued.

**Item 7**  
**Title:** LCQ21: Spinal muscular atrophy  
**URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202406/26/P2024062600664.htm  
**Summary:** Jun 2024 reply on SMA: Nusinersen and Risdiplam subsidy age limit 25 under CCF; Expert Panel view that evidence for adults >25 is limited; international guidelines under review.  
**Relevance:** **Option B (age limit).** Mainland has no age limit; HK restricts subsidy to under 25. Use for questions on updating evidence and relaxing/phasing age limit.

**Item 8**  
**Title:** Hong Kong patients want faster, cheaper treatments. Now they’re flocking to mainland China  
**URL:** https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3271269/hong-kong-patients-want-faster-cheaper-treatments-now-theyre-flocking-mainland-china  
**Summary:** SCMP on HK patients going north for care: e.g. cancer drug HK$30,000+/month in HK vs ~5,000 yuan/month in Shenzhen; long waits in HK; GBA integration (e.g. HKU–Shenzhen Hospital, 40,000+ HK outpatient visits in Q1 2024).  
**Relevance:** **Strong evidence for focus:** patients already vote with their feet; Mainland prices a fraction of HK; government frames GBA as *convenience* (cross-border care) but does not encourage HA to procure from Mainland. Use for “targeted engagement” and affordability arguments.

**Item 9**  
**Title:** Up to ‘10 times cheaper’: More Hong Kongers seek healthcare in mainland China  
**URL:** https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/up-to-10-times-cheaper-more-hong-kongers-seek-healthcare-in-mainland-china  
**Summary:** Straits Times: HK residents seeking care in Mainland; costs “up to 10 times cheaper”; HKU–Shenzhen and other GBA hospitals; visits in 2024 1.5–2× vs 2022–2023.  
**Relevance:** Reinforces price gap and trend; supports asking whether government will explore procurement or reference pricing to improve affordability in HK rather than only cross-border use.

**Item 10**  
**Title:** Another new drug approved under "1+" Mechanism / Two more new drugs approved under "1+" mechanism  
**URL (example):** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202407/05/P2024070500620.htm ; https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202411/12/P2024111200460.htm  
**Summary:** Govt press releases on further “1+” approvals (e.g. cancer, PNH, anaemia); some added to HA formulary with subsidy.  
**Relevance:** Shows “1+” in use for serious/rare conditions; does not address procurement from Mainland. Use to contrast “1+” (registration) with “procurement from Mainland” (not pursued).

**Item 11**  
**Title:** RARE DISEASE HONG KONG (rdhk.org)  
**URL:** https://rdhk.org/?lang=en  
**Summary:** NGO/civil society site for rare disease in HK (English).  
**Relevance:** Potential source for patient/carer perspectives and advocacy; may have updates on policy and drug access; cross-check with official and media sources.

**Item 12**  
**Title:** Hospital Authority welcomes 2024-25 Budget  
**URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202402/28/P2024022800700.htm  
**Summary:** HA response to 2024–25 Budget: subvention ~$95.4b (recurrent ~$93.5b), 2% increase; supports healthcare including services.  
**Relevance:** Context for HA funding; no direct link to Mainland procurement but useful for overall resourcing when discussing cost of drugs and subsidies.
