## What search4focus.md specifies

The instruction file asks the team / AI to:

1. Review the texts and docs in `genAI2026/gcap3056/group6-rare-disease`.
2. Consider **CourseInfo/week4Look4focus.md** (week 4 focus: find issues, formulate hypotheses, bridge info ↔ questions for government).
3. Do another round of **online search**, focusing on **gov.hk**, **scmp.com**, and other sites, plus general search.
4. Create **moreDocs.md** with titles, URLs, and summaries of found documents.
5. Create **hypotheses.md** with proposed hypotheses to guide next steps.
6. One specific interest: **how the HK government may engage the Mainland to obtain cheaper drugs** (e.g. for rare diseases / SMA).

## AI work performed in this chat

| # | Action | Outcome |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | Read **search4focus.md** | Confirmed the six-step task list and the Mainland-engagement interest. |
| 2 | Listed **group6-rare-disease** folder | Noted existing files: fetchGoogleDoc.md, public-info.md, summary2Feb.md, task3.1/3.2-instructions.md, etc. |
| 3 | Read **CourseInfo/week4Look4focus.md** | Confirmed Week 4 approach: critically review HK government decisions, find issues, formulate hypotheses; hypotheses need evidence; they bridge "info we find" and "questions we raise". |
| 4 | Read **summary2Feb.md** (partial) | Reviewed curated public info (Google Doc export): SCMP, GovHK, Policy Address, HKCH; LCQ16 reply on rare diseases, subsidies, age limits, "1+" registration, GBA cooperation. |
| 5 | Create **chatHistory01.md** (first version) | Summary of chat + search4focus tasks + AI actions. |
| 6 | Online search | Searched gov.hk, info.gov.hk, scmp.com, general web for rare disease / SMA, HK policy, Mainland engagement, cheaper drugs. Fetched key pages (LCQ16, "1+" extension, SCMP articles). |
| 7 | Create **moreDocs.md** (first version) | 17 entries in table format: GovHK (8), SCMP/other (9); titles, URLs, summaries; themes section for hypotheses. |
| 8 | Create **hypotheses.md** | Potential focus: Mainland procurement vs independent drug regime (gov does not encourage HA to procure from Mainland; GBA framed as convenience / fast-track Mainland approval, not HA buying Mainland drugs). Other options: B–E (SMA age limit, speed of access, support for patients obtaining drugs in Mainland, price transparency / cross-boundary medication). |
| 9 | Reform **moreDocs.md** | Removed table format; made all URLs **clickable** (markdown links); added **excerpts** where retrievable (LCQ16 reply and question, "1+" extension, SCMP "flocking to mainland", SCMP "fast-track mainland approval"). |
| 10 | Update **chatHistory01.md** | This file: added user requests #2–4; expanded AI work list; updated status and next steps. |
