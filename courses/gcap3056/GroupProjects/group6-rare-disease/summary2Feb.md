## Summary of each doc (by tab)

### Tab 1 – Carrie Lam promises life-saving drug (SCMP, Oct 2017)
- **URL:** https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/2117508/carrie-lam-promises-patients-she-will-personally  
- **Summary:** Chief Executive Carrie Lam met rare disease patients (including SMA) and promised to personally ensure access to a life-saving drug (nusinersen). She directed the Food and Health Secretary to negotiate with the manufacturer and pledged government support for compassionate access. Highlights gaps in Hong Kong’s drug registration and access for rare diseases.

### Tab 2 – SMA patients and spare machines (SCMP, Dec 2012)
- **URL:** https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1095238/spinal-muscular-atrophy-patients-put-trust-spare-machines  
- **Summary:** Describes families’ reliance on the Families of SMA Charitable Trust for spare life-sustaining equipment (e.g. cough-assist machines). When a machine failed, the trust provided a replacement the same day. Shows that specialised, expensive equipment is not easily replaceable and that charity fills a critical gap.

### Tab 3 – Brave Hong Kong boy, Marcus Ng (SCMP, Sep 2021)
- **URL:** https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3149289/brave-hong-kong-boy-rare-disorder-faces-his  
- **Summary:** Marcus Ng, 10, has SMA with about 10% lung function. He was about to undergo high-risk spinal surgery for scoliosis to try to improve breathing. His mother appealed for public support. Illustrates the physical and emotional burden of SMA and the role of surgery in severe cases.

### Tab 4 – LCQ16: Support for patients with rare diseases (GovHK, Jun 2024) – full Q&A
- **URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202406/12/P2024061200662p.htm  
- **Summary:** Legislative Council written reply by the Secretary for Health (Prof Lo Chung-mau) to Hon Tang Ka-piu. Covers: HA databases for uncommon disorders (35 now, 207 planned); CCF Ultra-expensive Drugs Programme and subsidy figures (e.g. Nusinersen 80 applications, HK$183.54m; Risdiplam 47, HK$74.19m); age limit for SMA drug subsidies (no subsidy for adults over 25, citing limited evidence); “1+” drug registration; GBA healthcare cooperation; and that the Government does not encourage HA to procure directly from the Mainland.

### Tab 5 – Spinal Muscular Atrophy information (HKCH PDF)
- **Source:** Spinal_Muscular_Atrophy_Information_Eng.pdf (Hong Kong Children’s Hospital).  
- **Summary:** Patient information on SMA: definition, cause (SMN1 gene, 5q-SMA), inheritance, diagnosis, symptoms/signs, and treatment. Describes types 1–4, multidisciplinary care, and disease-modifying drugs, with best outcomes when treatment starts early (including newborn screening).

### Tab 6 – Carmen Yau, sex rights advocate (SCMP)
- **URL:** https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3094360/born-spinal-muscular-atrophy-carmen-yau-sex  
- **Summary:** Profile of Carmen Yau Ka-man, born with SMA, now a sex-rights and disability advocate (e.g. Association of Women with Disabilities Hong Kong, Equal Opportunity Commission). Covers her diagnosis, education, work (including Families of SMA Charitable Trust), and advocacy on sexuality and independence for people with disabilities.

### Tab 7 – Drug trial brings new hope (SCMP)
- **URL:** https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/2003739/drug-trial-brings-new-hope-sufferers-rare-genetic  
- **Summary:** Reports a clinical drug trial in Hong Kong for SMA that gave hope to patients and families. Early results were seen as promising; experts and patient groups called for broader access. At the time, there was no effective SMA therapy in Hong Kong; the trial was framed as a potential breakthrough.

### Tab 8 – 10-year-old boy’s risky operation (SCMP)
- **URL:** https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3150461/10-year-old-hong-kong-boy-born-incurable-disease  
- **Summary:** Follow-up on Marcus Ng: eight-hour spinal surgery at a public hospital to correct scoliosis and help breathing. Describes the operation, family’s consent and stress, and recovery. Puts his case in the context of rare disease care in Hong Kong (cost, access, emotional burden).

### Tab 9 – LCQ16 reply (GovHK, Jun 2024) – abridged / alternative
- **URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202406/12/P2024061200662.htm  
- **Summary:** Same LCQ16 reply as Tab 4 (support for rare disease patients), in a shorter or alternative format. Reiterates HA and Government stance on evidence-based drug appraisal, CCF subsidies, age limit for SMA drugs, “1+” mechanism, GBA cooperation, and independence of Hong Kong’s drug regulatory and procurement regime.

### Tab 10 – Reply to Hon Michael Tien on SMA drug subsidies (GovHK, Jun 2024)
- **URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202406/26/P2024062600664.htm  
- **Summary:** Government reply on CCF subsidy for ultra-expensive drugs including Nusinersen and Risdiplam for SMA. States average subsidy per application was about HK$2 million in 2023–24; explains SMA types I–IV and that subsidies apply to pre-symptomatic and Types I–III; confirms no subsidy for adult SMA patients at this stage, with reference to international evidence. Notes non-drug support (rehabilitation, equipment, etc.) for adult SMA patients.

### Tab 11 – Review: Hong Kong’s healthcare resources for SMA
- **Summary:** A review document (no single URL) drawing on government and media sources (2012–2025). Identifies: (1) age limit (25) for drug subsidies as a major barrier; (2) high drug costs and limited procurement innovation; (3) reactive, crisis-driven policy (e.g. CE intervention in 2017); (4) long-term care reliant on charities (e.g. equipment); (5) data gaps. Poses five key questions and five preliminary hypotheses on evidence, cost-effectiveness, data, procurement, and integrated care.

- **Summary:** Web version of HKCH’s SMA patient information (aligned with Tab 5 PDF).

Contact: Department of Clinical Genetics, HKCH.

### Tab 15 – LCQ16: Support for patients with rare diseases (info.gov.hk index)
- **URL:** https://www.info.gov.hk (LCQ16 written reply, Jun 2024).
