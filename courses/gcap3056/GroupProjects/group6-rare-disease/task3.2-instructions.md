---

## Your Google Doc Link

**Your Google Doc:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IplYThZIHmhCy0a8tcycNCAmia80iBRFTGT8La2ZUoU/edit

You already have 4 sources in your Google Doc. Now add 2-3 more.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### STEP 1: Find New Sources

Here are places to search:

| Where to Search | What to Search For |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Google | `Hong Kong rare disease policy` |
| Google | `Hong Kong SMA drug subsidy` |
| Google | `Hong Kong Hospital Authority rare disease` |
| SCMP | `scmp.com rare disease Hong Kong` |
| RTHK | `news.rthk.hk rare disease` |
| Gov.HK | `site:gov.hk rare disease 2024` |

---

### STEP 2: Choose a Good Source

When you find an article or document, ask yourself:

| Question | Good Answer | Bad Answer |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Is it about Hong Kong? | Yes | No (about another country) |
| Is it from a reliable source? | Government, news, academic | Random blog |
| Is it relevant to rare disease policy? | Yes | Only mentions rare disease once |
| Can you read it? | Yes, in English or Chinese | No, it's in another language |

---

### STEP 3: Open Your Google Doc

1. Click this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IplYThZIHmhCy0a8tcycNCAmia80iBRFTGT8La2ZUoU/edit
2. Scroll to the bottom of the document
3. Click to start typing

---

### STEP 4: Add a New Tab (Optional)

Your document already has tabs. You can add more:
1. Right-click on a tab at the top
2. Click "Duplicate" or "Insert right"
3. Rename the new tab

---

### STEP 5: Fill in the Template

For EACH new source, copy and paste this template, then fill it in:

```
---

## Source Title: [Write the title of the article here]

| Field | Your Entry |
|-------|------------|
| **Contributor** | [Your name] |
| **URL** | [Paste the full link here] |
| **Date Published** | [When was it published?] |
| **Source Type** | [News article / Government document / Academic paper] |

### Fact 1
[Write one important fact from this source]

### Comment 1
[Write your thought or question about this fact]

### Fact 2
[Write another important fact]

### Comment 2
[Write your thought or question]

### Key Excerpt
> [Copy and paste an important quote from the article]

---
```

### STEP 6: Example Entry (Copy and Modify This)

```

## Source Title: Government launches "1+" mechanism for new drug registration

| Field | Your Entry |
|-------|------------|
| **Contributor** | [Your name] |
| **URL** | https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202310/31/P2023103100342.htm |
| **Date Published** | October 31, 2023 |
| **Source Type** | Government press release |

### Fact 1
The "1+" mechanism allows new drugs approved by one recognized overseas authority to be registered in Hong Kong more quickly.

### Comment 1
This could help rare disease patients get access to new treatments faster. But I wonder how many rare disease drugs have been approved through this mechanism so far?

### Fact 2
The recognized authorities include FDA (USA), EMA (Europe), and NMPA (China).

### Comment 2
Since China's NMPA is included, maybe drugs available cheaper in mainland China can now be registered in HK more easily?

### Key Excerpt
> "The 1+ mechanism will expedite the registration of new drugs that treat serious or life-threatening conditions with no local alternatives."

## Tip: Course Materials on GitHub

You may refer to the course folder on GitHub: [genAI2026/gcap3056](https://github.com/tesolchina/genAI2026/tree/main/gcap3056). The teacher may use an AI agent to add online materials there. You can also learn to use **GitHub Copilot agent** for research and writing. [More details here (Moodle forum)](https://buelearning.hkbu.edu.hk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=347873).

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "I can't find any new sources"
**Solution:** Try different keywords. Instead of "rare disease," try:
- "uncommon disorder"
- "orphan drug"
- "SMA Hong Kong"
- "genetic disease treatment"

### Problem: "I can't edit the Google Doc"
**Solution:** Make sure you're signed in with your Google account. If it still doesn't work, email your teacher.

### Problem: "I don't know what to write in the comments"
**Solution:** Ask yourself:
- Why is this fact important?
- What does this mean for patients?
- What question does this raise?
- Is this good or bad news?

## What to Do for Step 2 (Formulate Hypotheses)

   - Example: Drug approval is too slow
   - Example: Age limits on subsidies are unfair
   - Example: Not enough support for families

   - Example: Remove age limits on drug subsidies
   - Example: Create more equipment loan programs
