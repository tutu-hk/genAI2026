# Hypotheses – potential focus and other options

**Purpose (per week4Look4focus):** Hypotheses are the bridge between the info we find and the questions we will raise for the government. They suggest possible improvements; each requires evidence to support or refute.

**Status:** We are open to other options. Below: one **potential focus** (currently favoured) and **alternative foci** that the same evidence could support.

---

## Potential focus (current lead)

### Mainland procurement vs independent drug regime

**Finding from docs:**  
The Government does not encourage the Hospital Authority (HA) to procure drugs directly from the Mainland or to join the Mainland’s drug procurement mechanism. It emphasises an independent drug regulatory regime, quality and safety, and “one country, two systems.” Cooperation with the Mainland is framed as **GBA convenience** (e.g. HKU–Shenzhen follow-ups) and a future HK–Shenzhen centre using HK real-world data to **speed up Mainland approval** of drugs—not as HA buying Mainland drugs for use in Hong Kong.

**Why it might be a good focus:**  
- Directly addresses the team interest: *how might the HK government engage the Mainland to get cheaper drugs for patients (e.g. rare disease / SMA)?*  
- There is a clear, criticisable **policy choice**: prioritising regulatory independence over exploring procurement cooperation, while patients (and LegCo) report Mainland drug prices at a fraction of HK (e.g. ~5% of HK public hospital prices; cancer drugs &lt;1/5).  
- We can ask whether the current stance is **necessary as stated** (e.g. whether quality/safety could be assured under defined cooperation) or whether there is room to explore **targeted** engagement (e.g. specific drug categories, joint procurement studies) without giving up “primary evaluation” or international recognition.

**Hypothesis (to be tested):**  
*The Government could explore forms of engagement with the Mainland (e.g. joint procurement pilots, reference to Mainland pricing in negotiations, or conditional procurement for certain ultra-expensive drugs) that preserve quality and regulatory standards while improving affordability for rare disease and other high-cost drugs.*

**Evidence we have:**  
- LCQ16 reply (Jun 2024): explicit “do not encourage” HA to procure from Mainland or join Mainland mechanism; emphasis on regime differences and HA’s existing bargaining power.  
- SCMP / other: Mainland Nusinersen price cut (NHSA negotiation); HK patients going north for cheaper drugs; LegCo question citing ~5% Mainland vs HK prices.  
- moreDocs.md #1, #2, #9, #12, #13, #17.

**Evidence we may need:**  
- Whether any other jurisdiction with an “independent” regime has allowed conditional procurement from a neighbouring market; whether HA has ever assessed feasibility of joint or reference-price cooperation with Mainland for specific drugs; official reasoning (if any) beyond the published reply.

## Other options (alternative foci)

We can switch focus or add a second strand. Other plausible hypotheses from the same docs:

---

### Option B: SMA drug subsidy age limit (adults over 25)

**Finding:**  
Subsidy for Nusinersen and Risdiplam (SMA) is only for patients under 25. Government cites limited evidence of benefit in adults; Expert Panel will keep evidence under review.

**Hypothesis:**  
*Relaxing or phasing the age limit for SMA drug subsidies (with clear criteria and review) would improve outcomes and equity for adult SMA patients, if emerging evidence supports benefit.*

**Evidence we have:**  
- LCQ16 reply (3); summary2Feb.md; moreDocs.md.  
**Evidence we may need:**  
- Latest international guidelines and real-world data on adult SMA treatment; cost–benefit if age limit were relaxed.

---

### Option C: Speed and breadth of access to rare disease drugs (beyond “1+”)

**Finding:**  
“1+” has been extended to all new drugs; first advanced therapy product approved. Still: LegCo and media report “road to treatment is slow,” limited drug types, and high cost in public hospitals.

**Hypothesis:**  
*Faster listing on HA Drug Formulary and safety net for drugs already registered under “1+” (and clearer timelines for ultra-expensive/rare disease drugs) would reduce delay and inequity.*

**Evidence we have:**  
- moreDocs.md #3, #5, #6, #12; LCQ16 on “1+” and HADF.  
**Evidence we may need:**  
- Time from registration to formulary listing for recent “1+” drugs; HA criteria and process for Special Drug / safety net.

---

### Option D: Support for patients who obtain drugs or care in the Mainland

**Finding:**  
Government frames GBA measures as “additional choice” for those living in the Mainland, not as encouraging patients to go north for drugs. No systematic support (e.g. cross-boundary drug delivery, transport, or information) for rare disease patients who buy drugs in the Mainland.

**Hypothesis:**  
*Providing clear information, and where feasible practical support (e.g. referral pathways, continuity of care with HK clinicians), for patients who legally obtain drugs in the Mainland could improve safety and outcomes without the Government endorsing HA procurement from the Mainland.*

**Evidence we have:**  
- LCQ16 (5)(6); moreDocs.md #9, #15; Pilot Scheme (HKU–Shenzhen).  
**Evidence we may need:**  
- Current guidance to patients on buying drugs in Mainland; any existing referral or follow-up arrangements.

---

### Option E: Drug price transparency and cross-boundary medication (LCQ22)

**Finding:**  
LCQ22 reply (Oct 2025) mentions accelerating regulatory reform, cross-boundary medication services, and drug price transparency “similar to Mainland practices.”

**Hypothesis:**  
*Greater transparency in HA drug pricing and procurement (and clear policy on cross-boundary medication services) would allow public and LegCo to assess whether affordability and access could be improved.*

**Evidence we have:**  
- moreDocs.md #5.  
**Evidence we may need:**  
- What “price transparency similar to Mainland” means in practice; timeline for cross-boundary medication services.

## Next steps

1. **Choose focus:** Confirm potential focus (Mainland procurement / independent regime) or pick one/several of Options B–E (or combine).  
2. **Gather evidence:** For the chosen hypothesis, list what we already have and what we still need (official replies, data, overseas examples).  
3. **Formulate questions for government:** Turn the hypothesis into precise, answerable questions for the government (e.g. LegCo questions, FOI, or policy dialogue).
