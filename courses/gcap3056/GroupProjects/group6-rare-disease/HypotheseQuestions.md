# Hypotheses and questions for government staff

**Project:** Group 6 — Healthcare support for patients with rare diseases in Hong Kong  
**Purpose:** Explore the hypothesis on HK–Mainland partnership; raise questions for government (e.g. under Code on Access to Information); anticipate answers; prepare for limited disclosure.  
**References:** `hypotheses.md`, `AIwebsearch/AIsearchReport.md`, `public-info.md`, `summary2Feb.md`, `moreDocs.md`.

## 1. Hypothesis we are testing

- **Focus:** The Hong Kong government could work with Mainland authorities on procuring and securing rare disease drugs to improve affordability and access.
- **Hypothesis:** *More partnership could benefit patients, but there are administrative and political hurdles that could be overcome with sufficient political will.*
- **What we already know (from docs):**
  - LCQ16 (Jun 2024): Government does **not** encourage HA to procure from Mainland or join the Mainland procurement mechanism; emphasises independent regime, quality, safety, “one country, two systems.” ([LCQ16](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202406/12/P2024061200662.htm))
  - LegCo and media: some patients buy drugs from Mainland at around **5% of HK prices**; cancer drugs in Mainland at less than one-fifth of HK prices. (LCQ16; [SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3271269/hong-kong-patients-want-faster-cheaper-treatments-now-theyre-flocking-mainland-china))
  - LCQ8 (Dec 2024): Introduction of Mainland drugs via NPP; challenges include cumbersome procedures, long approval, full prepayment. ([LCQ8](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202412/11/P2024121100452.htm))
  - HA uses Mainland **disease lists** (207 rare diseases) but not Mainland **procurement**. (LCQ5 Sep 2025; AIsearchReport Item 1)
  - “1+” mechanism speeds up **registration** in HK; does not address **procurement** from Mainland. (AIsearchReport Items 5, 6, 10)

## 2. Questions for government staff

*(To be sent to the relevant bureau/department, e.g. Health Bureau, HA, via Code on Access to Information or similar. Adapt wording as needed.)*

### Block A: Current stance and rationale

- **Q1.** What is the Government’s current policy on the Hospital Authority procuring drugs (including rare disease drugs) from the Mainland or participating in the Mainland’s drug procurement mechanism? Please provide any internal guidelines or criteria that set out this position.
- **Q2.** Beyond the reasons already given in the reply to LCQ16 (June 2024), has the Government or the HA conducted any assessment of the feasibility of joint procurement, reference pricing, or conditional procurement with the Mainland for specific ultra-expensive or rare disease drugs? If yes, please provide the scope and conclusions (or a summary). If no, please confirm and state whether any such assessment is planned.

### Block B: Hurdles and possible engagement

- **Q3.** What specific administrative, regulatory, or legal hurdles does the Government consider would need to be addressed before the HA could procure certain drugs from the Mainland (or use Mainland prices as a reference in negotiations), while maintaining quality and safety standards?
- **Q4.** Has the Government considered or explored any pilot schemes (e.g. for a defined list of rare disease or high-cost drugs) to test cooperation with Mainland authorities on procurement or pricing, without changing the principle of primary evaluation in Hong Kong? If yes, please describe. If no, please state whether this is under consideration.

### Block C: Patient access and information

- **Q5.** What guidance or information does the Government or the HA provide to rare disease patients who are considering or already obtaining drugs from the Mainland (e.g. via NPP or personal purchase)? Is there any referral or follow-up arrangement with Mainland hospitals for such patients?
- **Q6.** In LCQ16 (June 2024) it was stated that some patients buy drugs from the Mainland at around 5% of HK public hospital prices. Does the Government collect or estimate data on how many rare disease patients obtain drugs from the Mainland? If so, please provide a summary. If not, please state the reason.

## 3. Anticipated possible answers and how they help

| Question | Possible answer (examples) | How it helps the project |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Q1 | Restatement of “do not encourage” + reference to LCQ16 or internal memo | Confirms current policy and gives a citable source; if internal doc is released, we see exact wording and scope. |
| Q1 | Refusal or “no internal guidelines” | Still useful: we can state that policy is not set out in a single document; supports asking for a clear, public position. |
| Q2 | “No assessment has been conducted” | Supports our argument that government has not explored feasibility; we can ask in report why not and recommend one. |
| Q2 | “An assessment was done; summary attached” | Direct evidence for or against our hypothesis; we use it in report and recommendations. |
| Q3 | List of hurdles (e.g. GMP, PIC/S, liability) | We can discuss in report whether each could be addressed with political will and cite official view. |
| Q4 | “No pilot” or “under consideration” | Clarifies whether targeted engagement is on the table; if “no,” we argue for it; if “under consideration,” we track and cite. |
| Q5 | Description of existing guidance (or “no specific guidance”) | Shows level of support for patients who go north; gap supports Option D (support for patients obtaining drugs in Mainland). |
| Q6 | Figures or “we do not collect” | If figures: evidence of scale; if not collected: we recommend data collection to inform policy. |

## 4. If little or no information is provided

- **Refusal or heavy redaction:** Note in the report that the request was made and what was refused or redacted; use the refusal itself as evidence that the government is not transparent on this issue; recommend that the Government publish a clear, reasoned position on HK–Mainland procurement cooperation.
- **“Already answered in LCQ16”:** Cite LCQ16 and state that we are asking for *further* detail (e.g. assessments, hurdles, pilots); if they decline, we record that and argue that the LegCo reply alone is insufficient for public and LegCo to assess the policy.
- **Very short or generic reply:** Use the exact wording in the report; contrast with what we asked; argue that more specific information is needed for accountability and for assessing whether hurdles could be overcome.
- **No reply within the statutory period:** Document the delay; consider follow-up or escalation as per Code on Access to Information; mention in report as a transparency and accountability issue.
