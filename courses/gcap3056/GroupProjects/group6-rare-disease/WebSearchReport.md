1. **[LCQ16: Support for patients with rare diseases](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202406/12/P2024061200662.htm)**  
   - **Date:** 12 Jun 2024.  
   - **Summary:** Government does not encourage HA to procure from Mainland; HA databases expanded to 207 uncommon disorders; “1+” from Nov 2023; some patients buy drugs from Mainland at ~5% of HK public hospital prices; age limit (25) for SMA drug subsidies questioned.  
   - **Relevance:** **Core evidence** for Mainland procurement focus; explicit policy stance; use for hypotheses and questions to government.  
   - **Follow-up:** Ask whether government has assessed targeted procurement or reference pricing with Mainland; cite 5% price gap.

2. **[LCQ22: Hospital Authority's drug procurement and prescription](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202411/13/P2024111300553.htm)**  
   - **Date:** 13 Nov 2024.  
   - **Summary:** HA drug procurement expenditure by category (general, anti-coronavirus, cancer, rare disease, special drugs); drug selection, safety and efficacy policies.  
   - **Relevance:** Official **procurement framework**; no Mainland; use to ask if HA has ever assessed joint/reference-price cooperation.  
   - **Follow-up:** Code on Access to Information for procurement assessment documents.

3. **[LCQ8: Introduction of drugs for use in Hong Kong](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202412/11/P2024121100452.htm)**

   - **Summary:** Introducing new drugs (including oncology) from Mainland: Named Patient Programme (NPP), challenges (cumbersome procedures, long approval, full prepayment), GMP, PIC/S.  
   - **Relevance:** **Introduction** of Mainland drugs (registration/NPP), not bulk HA procurement; supports “current pathway is individual/NPP” and “pilot procurement or reference pricing” questions.  
   - **Follow-up:** Ask whether government will simplify NPP or explore bulk procurement for specific high-cost drugs.

4. **[Hongkongers to get faster, cheaper access to new medicines under improved system](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3285545/hongkongers-get-faster-cheaper-access-new-medicines-improved-procurement-system)**  
   - **Summary:** HA streamlined drug approval (mid-Nov 2024); two-tier assessment removed; direct head office application; ~10 months → ~5 months; pharma companies can apply directly.  
   - **Relevance:** **Improvement** in registration/speed; does not address procurement from Mainland; contrast with affordability gap.  
   - **Follow-up:** Use “faster + cheaper” headline to ask whether “cheaper” includes Mainland procurement or only process speed.

## Round 5 — HK patients Mainland drugs GBA cheaper 2024

1. **[Hong Kong patients want faster, cheaper treatments. Now they're flocking to mainland China](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3271269/hong-kong-patients-want-faster-cheaper-treatments-now-theyre-flocking-mainland-china)**  
   - **Summary:** Cancer drug example: HK$30,000+/month in HK vs ~5,000 yuan/month in Shenzhen; long waits in HK; GBA (e.g. HKU–Shenzhen Hospital, 40,000+ HK outpatient visits Q1 2024).  
   - **Relevance:** **Strong evidence** for focus: patients “vote with their feet”; Mainland prices a fraction of HK; government frames GBA as convenience, not HA procurement.  
   - **Follow-up:** Use for “targeted engagement” and affordability arguments; ask whether government will explore procurement or reference pricing to improve affordability in HK.

2. **[LCQ22: Hospital Authority's drug procurement and prescription](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202411/13/P2024111300553.htm)**

## Suggestions for the team (follow-up)

1. **Focus:** Mainland procurement vs independent drug regime (current lead); options B–E (SMA age limit, “1+”, etc.) as alternatives or complements.  
2. **Hypothesis (to test):** “The Government could explore forms of engagement with the Mainland (e.g. joint procurement pilots, reference to Mainland pricing in negotiations, or conditional procurement for certain ultra-expensive drugs) that preserve quality and regulatory standards while improving affordability for rare disease and other high-cost drugs.”  
3. **Questions for government:** Code on Access to Information or LegCo: (a) Has HA or government assessed joint or reference-price cooperation with Mainland for specific drugs? (b) Will government consider relaxing SMA subsidy age limit in light of Mainland practice and updated evidence? (c) How does government respond to LegCo suggestion to reference Mainland public drug price lists?  
4. **Further searches (optional):** International comparisons (conditional procurement from neighbouring market); 2025 LegCo Q&As on drug provision; RTHK/sources on SMA adult subsidy expansion (verify and link).  
5. **Google Doc & Moodle:** Update Google Doc; reply to Moodle task 4.1.  
6. **Full item list:** For more items (e.g. Straits Times, RARE DISEASE HONG KONG, HA Budget), see `AIwebsearch/AIsearchReport.md` in this folder.
