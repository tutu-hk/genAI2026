# Web search report — Group 2 Fire Service 1

**Project:** Group 2 — Fire Service 1 (incidents, emergency response, notification systems).  
**Purpose:** To find public info on FSD incidents, response, and alert systems for focus and hypotheses.  
**Method:** 5 rounds completed in one go. All results include **clickable links**, **titles**, **dates**, **summaries**, **relevance to project goals**, and **follow-up suggestions**.

---

## How searches were conducted

- **Tool:** Web search (cursor/IDE integrated).  
- **Rounds 1–5:** Round 1 (IT incident, data breach 2024); Round 2 (emergency alert system); Round 3 (Jordan fire 2024); Round 4 (Typhoon Saola, tree collapse); Round 5 (performance pledge, response time).

   - **Relevance:** Directly addresses **notification/response systems** (tree collapse reporting) and **data security**; supports “lessons from incidents” focus.  
   - **Follow-up:** Ask FSD about remediation and whether alert/reporting systems were changed; link to Emergency Alert System (Round 2).

2. **[Hong Kong fire service reports potential leak of personal data of 5,000 people](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3261641/hong-kong-fire-service-reports-potential-leak-personal-data-5000-staff-members-public)**

   - **Date:** 10 Apr 2024.  
   - **Summary:** No. 3 alarm fire, Jordan; CE condolences; instructs investigation and assistance; visits injured.  
   - **Relevance:** **Major incident** for “lessons learned” and **response** analysis.  
   - **Follow-up:** Use with BD/FSD follow-up releases for timeline and response adequacy.

2. **[Buildings Department highly concerned about fire incident in New Lucky House in Jordan](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202404/11/P2024041100013.htm)**  
   - **Date:** 11 Apr 2024.  
   - **Summary:** BD inspection; 2008 Fire Safety Direction uncomplied (fire doors, enclosures); 2023 repair tender in preparation.  
   - **Relevance:** **Prevention and enforcement** failure; supports “notification/enforcement” and “old buildings” focus.  
   - **Follow-up:** Ask FSD/BD about alert to residents and building management pre-fire; link to ordinance enforcement.

3. **[Fire at Hong Kong's New Lucky House kills at least 5, injures 35](https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2024/04/13/fire-at-hong-kongs-new-lucky-house-kills-at-least-5-injures-35)**

## Suggestions for the team (follow-up)

1. **Focus:** Choose among: (a) alert/notification effectiveness (EAS, FSD systems), (b) response time and major incidents (Jordan, Hung Shui Kiu), (c) data security and contractor oversight (IT breach).  
2. **Hypotheses:** e.g. “Improving public alert and FSD notification systems could reduce harm in fires and extreme weather.”  
3. **Questions for government:** FSD/OFCA on EAS use in fires and typhoons; FSD on post-breach changes to tree collapse reporting; BD on Fire Safety Direction enforcement for buildings like New Lucky House.  
4. **Google Doc & Moodle:** Update Google Doc; reply to Moodle task 4.1.
