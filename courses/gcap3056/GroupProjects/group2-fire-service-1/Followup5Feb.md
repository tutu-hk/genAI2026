# Follow-up Actions: Group 2 - Fire Service 1 (5 Feb 2026)

## Project Focus
Find the specific Fire Services unit that might be held accountable (especially related to learning from past fires like the London accident).

## Current Status
- General research framework on alert systems and emergency protocols documented
- Historical context needed: reference to learning from past incidents

---

## Action Items

### Phase 1: Research Past Incidents & Lessons Learned
- [ ] **Identify the "London accident" reference** - What specific fire incident? (e.g., historical comparison?) Clarify with teacher
- [ ] **Map HK fire incidents** - Compile list of major fires in past 5-10 years with details on response failures
- [ ] **Research FSD accountability mechanisms** - Are there public inquiries, internal reviews, or oversight bodies?
- [ ] **Contact Fire Services Department** - via HK directory or FOI requests for incident reports

### Phase 2: Identify Responsible Units Within Fire Services
- [ ] **Access FSD organizational chart** - https://tel.directory.gov.hk/index_FSD_ENG.html to locate:
  - Fire Investigation Unit
  - Training & Development Division
  - Operational Safety Branch
  - Public Education Section
- [ ] **Cross-reference** which units are responsible for fire prevention, education, and lessons learned
- [ ] **Document accountability pathways** - How are failures investigated? Who oversees improvements?

### Phase 3: Policy Recommendations
- [ ] **Draft questions for government** - On accountability structures, public disclosure of lessons learned
- [ ] **Create comparison matrix** - How do other jurisdictions handle post-incident learning?
- [ ] **Propose transparency mechanisms** - Public dissemination of fire investigation findings

## How AI Agents Can Help

✅ **Web Search & News Analysis**
- Search for major fire incidents in HK (past 5-10 years), news coverage, government responses
- Identify which government units made statements or took action
- Find any public inquiries or oversight reports

✅ **Data Organization & Mapping**
- Parse FSD directory structure and create organizational chart
- Link specific units to their responsibilities and public communications
- Build timeline of fire incidents and policy responses

✅ **Research & Analysis**
- Compare accountability structures in other jurisdictions (SG, UK, US)
- Analyze patterns in fire prevention education and enforcement
- Research international best practices for post-incident transparency

✅ **Document Drafting**
- Generate research briefing on FSD structure and accountability
- Draft interview questions for FSD representatives
- Create FOI request templates

## Next Steps
- Clarify which specific fire incident(s) to investigate
- Decide on FOI request strategy vs. direct outreach to FSD
- Discuss accountability framework approach
