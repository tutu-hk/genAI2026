## 12 February 2026 — Major data gathering and analysis session

### What was done (AI agent, directed by teacher)

**Task 1: TALK Hong Kong CSA Report → Markdown**
- Fetched the 44-page PDF: "Magnitude of Child Sexual Abuse in Hong Kong: Review of Evidence 2015-2024" by Taura Edgar, TALK Hong Kong (Dec 2025)
- Converted to structured markdown: `TALK_CSA_Report.md`
- Key findings extracted: 16% estimated CSA prevalence, 0.05% official reporting rate (vs 8% global), 96% unreported cases, 86% female victims, 93% male perpetrators
- Added project relevance section linking TALK data to Group 5 hypotheses

**Task 2: Google Doc → GoogleNotes.md**
- Fetched all content from the team's Google Doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugzSlI0w1_MEwWELp8U0TaOHPa4ojFjYrLmI7jFZ9eI/)
- Multiple tabs documented: Week 3 (public info curation), Week 4 (progress), Week 5 (government requests), Tasks 3-4, Government Questions (Joyce & Kenneth), Document Hypothesis, Reflective Journal Info, LegCo Report Draft
- Created: `GoogleNotes.md` dated 12 February 2026

**Task 3: DataGap.md — Data Access Gap Report**
- Created comprehensive report documenting 8 specific data gaps:
  1. No centralised CSA dataset
  2. No prevalence research
  3. No disclosure barrier research
  4. No technology-facilitated abuse tracking
  5. No education programme evaluation
  6. Inconsistent legal definitions
  7. No perpetrator profile data
  8. No longitudinal outcome data
- Included evidence from TALK, EOC, SCMP, RainLily, and team research
- Added recommendations: immediate, short-term, and long-term actions

**Task 4: SCMP Search → SCMPreports.md**
- Searched scmp.com using 5 targeted queries covering:
  - Sexual harassment Hong Kong (2024-2026)
  - Sexual assault law reform and data reporting (2023-2025)
  - Child sexual abuse prevention and education (2023-2025)
  - University students and EOC (2023-2025)
  - Sexual violence victim support and underreporting (2023-2025)
- Compiled 18 SCMP articles into 7 categories:

  5. Education and Sex Education (3 articles)
  6. University Sexual Harassment (3 articles)
  7. Image-Based Sexual Violence (1 article)
- Created summary table and key themes analysis
- Created: `SCMPreports.md`

**Task 5: Updated DataGap.md**
- DataGap.md was created with SCMP findings already integrated (tasks 3 and 4 done in parallel)

**Task 6: outlineDraft01.md — Narrowed Focus Outline**
- Created updated report outline (v2) building on original `outlineDraft.md`
- **Narrowed focus:** The Data Access Gap — how lack of publicly available, centralised data undermines prevention
- Proposed title: "Breaking the Silence with Data"
- Added comparison table showing evolution from v1 to v2
- 10 time-bound recommendations across 3 time horizons
- Media investigation angle: "The Numbers That Don't Exist"

**Task 7: govEnquiries.md — Government Questions**
- Created 23 specific questions across 6 government departments:
  - EOC: 4 questions (training reach, COMPASS, complaints, survey)
  - EDB: 4 questions (school compliance, sex education, complaints, teacher training)
  - DoJ/LRC: 5 questions (reform timeline, consent, persistent abuse, prosecution/sentencing data)
  - SWD: 4 questions (CSA data, mandatory reporting, neurodiverse, HSB)
  - Security Bureau: 3 questions (coordination, resources, barring mechanisms)
  - UGC: 3 questions (mandatory training, institutional data, funding)
- Each section includes anticipated responses and follow-up strategies
- Referenced Code on Access to Information (COAI) framework
- Incorporated questions from team members (Joyce and Kenneth from Google Doc)

**Task 8: Process Log**
- Created this `process.log` documenting all work done
