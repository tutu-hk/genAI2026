# Government Enquiries — Group 5: Prevent Sexual Harassment

**Date:** 12 February 2026  
**Project:** Group 5 — Prevent Sexual Harassment  
**Purpose:** Raise specific, evidence-based questions for government departments based on identified data gaps  
**Method:** Questions formulated under the **Code on Access to Information** (COAI)

---

## Strategy

### Approach
- Questions are based on evidence from the TALK CSA Report (2025), SCMP coverage, EOC surveys, and the team's research
- Each question specifies what data or information is being requested
- Questions are framed to be answerable and specific (avoiding vague or opinion-based questions)
- Anticipated responses and follow-up strategies are included

### Code on Access to Information (COAI)
- Hong Kong government's voluntary code for responding to information requests
- Departments should respond within 10 working days (or give a timeline for complex requests)
- Refusals should be justified with specific reasons
- [COAI Reference](https://www.access.gov.hk/en/code.htm)

## 1. Questions for the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC)

### Data and Programme Access
1. **Training reach:** How many individuals (students, workers, employers) participated in EOC anti-sexual harassment training programmes in 2023, 2024, and 2025? Please provide breakdown by sector (education, workplace, government).
2. **COMPASS effectiveness:** Since the launch of the COMPASS online learning platform in early 2024, how many individuals have completed the programme? What evaluation has been conducted on its effectiveness?
3. **Complaint data:** How many sexual harassment complaints did the EOC receive in 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025? Of these, how many proceeded to conciliation, and what were the outcomes (resolved, unresolved, withdrawn)?
4. **2024/25 survey:** Has the EOC conducted a follow-up survey on workplace sexual harassment since the 2021 survey? If so, what are the findings? If not, when is the next survey planned?

### Anticipated Response
- EOC may provide aggregate numbers but resist disaggregation by sector or institution
- May cite privacy concerns for complaint outcomes
- **Follow-up:** If refused, request anonymised/aggregated data; reference the 2018 university survey as precedent for publication

## 2. Questions for the Education Bureau (EDB)

### School Compliance and Education
5. **Policy compliance:** How many primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong have adopted written anti-sexual harassment policies, as required by EDB guidelines? What monitoring mechanism ensures compliance?
6. **Sex education evaluation:** What evaluation has been conducted on the 2024 sex education teaching materials for citizenship and economics classes? Has the EDB addressed the criticisms raised by sex education experts regarding the lack of consent education?
7. **Student complaints:** How many student complaints of sexual harassment were received by schools and reported to EDB in 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025?
8. **Teacher training:** How many teachers received training on handling disclosures of sexual harassment or abuse in 2023, 2024, and 2025?

### Anticipated Response
- EDB may state that compliance monitoring is the responsibility of individual schools
- May not collect centralised data on student complaints
- **Follow-up:** If compliance data is unavailable, recommend establishing a centralised reporting mechanism

## 3. Questions for the Department of Justice (DoJ) / Law Reform Commission (LRC)

### Legal Reform and Data
9. **Reform timeline:** What is the current timeline for the public consultation on sexual offence law reform? When is new legislation expected to be introduced to LegCo?
10. **Consent definition:** Will the proposed reforms include a statutory definition of consent that explicitly addresses "tonic immobility" (the "frozen" response)?
11. **Persistent abuse offence:** Will the reforms include a new offence of persistent sexual abuse, particularly of children, to address the current requirement for prosecutors to prove each assault separately?
12. **Prosecution data:** How many sexual offence cases were prosecuted in 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025? Of these, how many resulted in conviction, acquittal, or withdrawal? What was the average time from report to prosecution?
13. **Sentencing data:** What are the sentencing patterns for sexual offences over the past 5 years? Please provide breakdown by offence type, custodial vs. non-custodial sentences, and sentence length.

### Anticipated Response
- DoJ may provide aggregate prosecution data but resist breakdowns
- LRC may provide general reform timeline but not specific legislative drafts
- **Follow-up:** Reference TALK report's finding that 12% of convicted CSA perpetrators received non-custodial sentences; ask whether this is appropriate

## 4. Questions for the Social Welfare Department (SWD)

### Child Protection and Data
14. **CSA data publication:** Does the SWD plan to publish annual disaggregated data on child sexual abuse cases, including breakdown by type (contact/non-contact), victim-perpetrator relationship (intrafamilial/extrafamilial), and victim characteristics (age, gender, neurodiverse status)?
15. **Mandatory Reporting Ordinance implementation:** What preparations have been made for the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance (effective January 2026)? How many reports have been received since implementation? Will this data be published?
16. **Neurodiverse vulnerability:** Given that ~29% of CSA cases in 2024 involved neurodiverse victims (TALK report), what specific protective measures are in place for children with disabilities?
17. **Harmful Sexual Behaviour:** Given that 34% of CSA cases (2020–2024) involved children harming children, what intervention programmes exist for children displaying harmful sexual behaviour?

### Anticipated Response
- SWD may provide some aggregate data but resist detailed breakdowns
- May state that mandatory reporting data is being collected and will be published in due course
- **Follow-up:** Set a specific date by which publication is expected; reference TALK report data for comparison

## 5. Questions for the Security Bureau

### Policy Coordination
18. **Inter-departmental coordination:** What mechanism exists for coordinating data collection on sexual harassment and sexual abuse across SWD, HKPF, DoJ, EDB, and CSD? Is there a plan to create a centralised dataset?
19. **Mandatory reporting resources:** What budget has been allocated for implementing the Mandatory Reporting Ordinance in 2026? How many additional social workers, investigators, or support staff have been hired?
20. **Barring mechanisms:** What progress has been made on establishing a public Sexual Offences Register or barring service to prevent known offenders from working with children?

### Anticipated Response
- Security Bureau may redirect questions to specific departments
- May state that coordination exists through multidisciplinary case conferences
- **Follow-up:** Argue that ad hoc coordination is insufficient; a systemic data-sharing framework is needed

## 6. Questions for the University Grants Committee (UGC)

### University Standards
21. **Mandatory training:** Will the UGC consider making anti-sexual harassment and consent training a mandatory, credit-bearing requirement for graduation across all UGC-funded institutions?
22. **Institutional data:** Do UGC-funded institutions report data on sexual harassment complaints to the UGC? If so, what are the aggregate numbers for the past 5 years?
23. **EOC funding:** What additional recurrent funding is allocated to the EOC's Anti-Sexual Harassment Unit (ASHU) to meet the demand for in-person training at universities?

### Anticipated Response
- UGC may state that individual institutions set their own policies
- May not collect harassment complaint data centrally
- **Follow-up:** Argue that given only ~3,200 students trained in 2023 out of 300,000+ university students, the current voluntary approach is inadequate
