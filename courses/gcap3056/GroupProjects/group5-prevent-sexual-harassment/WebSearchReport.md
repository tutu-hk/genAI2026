2. **Hypotheses:** e.g. “Mandatory employer training and clearer victim pathways could reduce underreporting and improve outcomes.”  
3. **Questions for government:** EOC (training uptake, 2024 survey); DoJ (reform timeline, persistent abuse offence); EDB (school compliance); FHB/Labour (funding for RainLily-type services).  
4. **Google Doc & Moodle:** Update Google Doc; reply to Moodle task 4.1.
