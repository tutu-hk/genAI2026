## About TALK Hong Kong

TALK Hong Kong exists to prevent child sexual abuse and support survivors in Hong Kong. Founded in 2019 as a peer support group, it became an official charity in 2023. Through research, public awareness, and prevention training, TALK strives to shed light on the devastating impact of CSA and empower communities to prevent it.

## Executive Summary

### Objectives
The prevalence of child sexual abuse (CSA) in Hong Kong is not well known. This report aims to establish a Hong Kong-specific information hub about CSA across the various stages of a case (from occurrence to sentencing) by sourcing and analysing data on CSA from government departments and bureaus, NGOs, and academic resources.

The report seeks to:
1. Estimate the prevalence of CSA in Hong Kong
2. Illustrate what is known about CSA based on review and comparison of available data
3. Identify data that is not available, thereby inhibiting a more comprehensive understanding
4. Promote awareness and collaboration among stakeholders to improve child safety

### Methodology
- **Prevalence section:** Uses studies and meta-analyses of international and China/HK peer-reviewed journals involving general populations of young people and adults, specifying rates for males and females individually.
- **What We Know section:** Reviews evidence from HK government departments and NGOs from 2015–2024.

### Key Results

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Estimated CSA prevalence** | 16% of the population (20% females, 11% males) |
| **Estimated unreported cases** | As high as 96% |
| **HK official reporting rate** | 0.05% (vs global reporting rate of ~8%) |
| **SWD reported cases (2015–2024)** | Average 372 cases/year; 86% female victims; 93% male perpetrators |
| **Neurodiverse victims (2024)** | ~29% of cases |
| **Harmful Sexual Behaviour (children harming children, 2020–2024)** | 34% of cases |
| **HKPF reported cases (2016–2024)** | Average 476 cases/year; 74% victims knew abuser; 73% victims aged 12–16 |
| **DoJ charges (2015–2024)** | Average 51 charges/year; 79% guilty verdict; 12% convicted received non-custodial sentence |

### Discussion Highlights
- Hong Kong's official CSA reporting rate of 0.05% falls far below the estimated global rate of 8%
- Gap attributed to underreporting and lack of local research on disclosure barriers
- Vulnerable populations (neurodiverse children) at higher risk
- 22% of reported persons who harmed are 16 or under — need for intervention rather than criminalisation
- The 2026 Mandated Reporting Ordinance expected to significantly increase case reporting

### 10 Recommendations
1. Increase public awareness, education and understanding of CSA
2. Improve deterrence and interruption of abuse pathways
3. Improve regulation of the workforce
4. Greater use and public availability of barring services
5. Establish a public single core dataset of victims and perpetrators
6. Commission Hong Kong-specific perpetration prevalence research
7. Review the justice response to CSA
8. Improve support for victims and survivors of CSA
9. Continue legislative change efforts
10. Increase awareness of evolving challenges

## Defining and Framing Child Sexual Abuse

### Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Child** | Every human below the age of 18 |
| **Child Maltreatment** | Any act of commission or omission that endangers or impairs the physical/psychological health and development of an individual under 18 |
| **Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)** | Any sexual behaviour (looking, showing, or touching) with a child; all sexual engagement between an adult and a child; child under 16 can never consent |
| **CSAM** | Child sexual abuse material — any content depicting sexualised images of a child (photos, videos, live streaming, AI-generated content) |
| **Harmful Sexual Behaviour (HSB)** | Sexual behaviours by children outside developmental/social/cultural expectations, causing harm; may occur face-to-face or via technology |
| **Intrafamilial CSA** | CSA within the family environment (biological relatives or familial-like role) |
| **Technology-facilitated CSA (TF-CSA)** | Sexually harmful behaviours online or through digital technologies |

### Legal Reflection: Definition of a Child in HK Law

A critical issue: Hong Kong does **not** use a consistent age to define a "child" across sexual offence laws:

- **Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance (Cap 579):** Child = under 16
- **Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse (Cap 650):** Child = under 18
- **Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200):** Various ages used:
  - Section 123: Intercourse with a girl under 13
  - Section 124: Intercourse with a girl under 16
  - Section 118C: Homosexual buggery with/by man under 16
  - Section 118D: Buggery with girl under 21
  - Section 127: Abduction of unmarried girl under 18 for sexual intercourse

Hong Kong also separates sexual offences by gender — rape is legally defined as committed only by a male against a female (laws presently under review).

## Prevalence Research

### Estimated Rate of CSA Prevalence

- CSA prevalence in Hong Kong is not well researched
- Official data from government departments underestimates true prevalence due to underreporting and limited case detection
- **TALK's estimate:** 16% of the population experienced CSA
  - **Females:** 7%–37% (average ~20%)
  - **Males:** 4%–19% (average ~11%)
- Based on brief systematic review of 7 international and Chinese academic studies (from 14 reviewed)
- Global reporting rate of CSA: ~8% (Mehta et al., 2023)
- **Hong Kong's current reporting rate: 0.05%** (522 cases out of 883,700 children)

### Estimated Rate of Unreported CSA Cases

- Based on prevalence comparison across international studies
- Unreported cases estimated as high as **96%**
- Significant gap between official statistics and likely reality

## Discussion

Key points from the discussion:

1. **Underreporting Crisis:** HK's official 0.05% reporting rate vs. estimated global 8% rate
2. **Disclosure Barriers:** Paucity of local research on why victims don't report
3. **Vulnerable Populations:** Neurodiverse children disproportionately affected (~29% in 2024)
4. **Children Harming Children:** 22% of reported persons who harmed are 16 or under
5. **Data Fragmentation:** No centralised, publicly available dataset on CSA
6. **Mandate Reporting:** New Mandated Reporting Ordinance (2026) expected to increase reporting
7. **Need for Prevention:** Education and awareness remain insufficient

---

## Recommendations

### Improving Prevention
1. **Increase public awareness, education and understanding of CSA** — comprehensive campaigns
2. **Improve deterrence and interruption of abuse pathways** — early intervention
3. **Improve regulation of the workforce** — vetting and training
4. **Greater use and public availability of barring services** — protect children from known offenders

### Improving Response
5. **Establish a public single core dataset** — unified data on victims and perpetrators
6. **Commission HK-specific perpetration prevalence research** — understand local patterns
7. **Review the justice response to CSA** — sentencing, support during proceedings
8. **Improve support for victims and survivors** — accessible, funded services

### Closing
9. **Continue legislative change efforts** — gender-neutral laws, consistent age definitions
10. **Increase awareness of evolving challenges** — technology-facilitated abuse, AI-generated CSAM

## Relevance to Group 5 Project

This report is **highly relevant** to the Group 5 project on preventing sexual harassment because:

1. **Data Gap Evidence:** The report itself is an example of the difficulty in accessing data — documenting requests denied and data unavailable from government departments
2. **Underreporting:** Reinforces the project's hypothesis on underreporting (0.05% vs 8% global rate)
3. **Education Gaps:** Supports the hypothesis that prevention education is insufficient
4. **Legal Inconsistencies:** Shows fragmented legal definitions that create confusion
5. **Government Accountability:** The 10 recommendations provide a framework for questions to government
6. **Mandated Reporting:** The 2026 ordinance is a key policy development to track
7. **Neurodiverse Vulnerability:** An underexplored dimension the project could investigate
8. **Children Harming Children:** HSB data suggests systemic failure in early intervention

---

## Key Data for Government Enquiries

Based on this report, the following questions can be raised:

1. Why does HK's official CSA reporting rate (0.05%) fall so far below the estimated global rate (8%)?
2. What data does the government hold that it has not made publicly available?
3. What specific barriers exist to disclosure and reporting in HK?
4. How will the 2026 Mandated Reporting Ordinance be implemented and resourced?
5. Why is there no centralised, publicly available dataset on CSA?
6. What plans exist for HK-specific prevalence research?
7. How are neurodiverse children being specifically protected?
8. What intervention programmes exist for children displaying harmful sexual behaviour?
