# Follow-up Actions: Group 5 - Prevent Sexual Harassment (5 Feb 2026)

## Project Focus
Identify specific government units and programs on preventing sexual harassment. Consider EOC role while acknowledging potential communication challenges.

## Current Status
- Key policy documents and legislative context identified
- Training participation data (universities) analyzed
- Underreporting and misconceptions documented
- Good foundation on the issue; now need to map government response

---

## Action Items

### Phase 1: Map Government Agencies & Programs
- [ ] **Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC)** 
  - [ ] Review EOC's current anti-harassment programs and resources
  - [ ] Document their consultation/proposal mechanisms
  - [ ] Note any known reluctance points (confidentiality, resource constraints)
- [ ] **Department of Justice (Sexual Violence Prosecution)**
  - [ ] Research specialized prosecution units or policies
  - [ ] Review training for judicial officers on sexual violence
- [ ] **Education Bureau**
  - [ ] Current mandatory education standards on sexual harassment (schools, universities)
  - [ ] Teacher training on handling disclosures
- [ ] **Labour Department**
  - [ ] Workplace sexual harassment regulations and enforcement
  - [ ] Current guidance and complaint mechanisms
- [ ] **Social Welfare Department**
  - [ ] Support services for victims (counseling, safe houses, legal aid)

### Phase 2: Identify & Analyze Gaps
- [ ] **Awareness campaigns** - What exists? Target audiences? Effectiveness?
- [ ] **Training requirements** - Are these mandatory? Reach? Quality?
- [ ] **Victim support services** - Are they accessible? Well-resourced?
- [ ] **Accountability** - How are perpetrators held accountable?
- [ ] **Data collection** - Do government units track prevalence and trends?

### Phase 3: Strategic Engagement & Recommendations
- [ ] **Develop inquiry strategy** - How to approach EOC and other agencies? (formal, informal, through intermediaries?)
- [ ] **Prepare case studies** - Use university training data (3,000 trained vs. 7,442 at HKBU) as evidence
- [ ] **Draft recommendations** - E.g., mandatory training, improved victim support, coordinated campaigns
- [ ] **Create policy questions** - Specific, evidence-based questions prepared in advance to overcome reluctance

## How AI Agents Can Help

✅ **Web Search & Agency Research**
- Search for EOC announcements, reports, and consultation papers
- Locate government statements on sexual harassment prevention
- Research funding allocations to victim support services

✅ **Data Analysis & Benchmarking**
- Analyze university training participation rates and effectiveness
- Compare HK government response to other jurisdictions (SG, UK, Australia)
- Research international best practices for integrated anti-harassment strategies

✅ **Policy & Legal Research**
- Summarize Sex Discrimination Ordinance provisions on harassment
- Research recent law reform proposals on sexual offences
- Analyze RainLily's reform recommendations for alignment with government approach

✅ **Stakeholder Mapping & Engagement Planning**
- Create comprehensive map of government units + their current programs
- Research EOC's track record on responsiveness to inquiries
- Draft strategic inquiry questions designed to elicit concrete responses
- Suggest intermediaries or advocacy groups who might facilitate access

## Key Challenges & Notes
- ⚠️ EOC may not be forthcoming - develop multiple inquiry pathways
- ⚠️ Different ministries may have overlapping/unclear responsibilities
- ⚠️ Training data suggests gaps despite existing programs

## Next Meeting Prep
- Review which government units to prioritize
- Discuss approach to EOC engagement
- Share findings on current programs and gaps
