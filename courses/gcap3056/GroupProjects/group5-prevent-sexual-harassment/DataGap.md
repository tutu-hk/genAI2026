# Data Gap Report: Sexual Harassment and Sexual Abuse in Hong Kong

**Date:** 12 February 2026  
**Project:** Group 5 — Prevent Sexual Harassment  
**Purpose:** Document the gap in data access on sexual harassment, sexual assault, and child sexual abuse in Hong Kong

---

## Executive Summary

Despite the severity of sexual harassment and sexual abuse in Hong Kong, there is a significant gap in publicly available data. Government departments and bureaus collect data for their own operational purposes but do not make it readily accessible to researchers, advocacy groups, journalists, or the public. This report identifies what data exists, what is missing, and why closing this gap matters for effective prevention and policy reform.

## 1. The Scale of the Problem

### What We Know
| Indicator | Data | Source |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Estimated CSA prevalence | 16% of population (20% female, 11% male) | TALK HK (2025) |
| Official CSA reporting rate | 0.05% | TALK HK (2025) |
| Global CSA reporting rate | ~8% | Mehta et al. (2023) |
| Estimated unreported CSA cases | Up to 96% | TALK HK (2025) |
| University students harassed (12 months) | 23% | EOC Survey (2018) |
| University students who filed complaints | <3% | EOC Survey (2018) |
| Women harassed at work (3 years) | 34% | SCMP/Survey (2025) |
| Sexual assault cases reaching police | 41.4% | SCMP (2025) |
| Conviction rate for reported sexual assaults | ~6% | SCMP (2025) |
| Average delay before seeking help | 4+ years | SCMP (2025) |

### The Underreporting Crisis
- Hong Kong's official CSA reporting rate (0.05%) is **160 times lower** than the estimated global reporting rate (8%)
- In universities, only 3% of those harassed file complaints
- In workplaces, most women who experience harassment take no action
- Survivors wait an average of 4+ years before seeking help

## 2. Data That Exists but Is Not Publicly Accessible

### 2.1 Government Data Gaps

The TALK Hong Kong report (2025) systematically requested data from multiple government departments and documented what was provided vs. denied. Key gaps include:

#### Social Welfare Department (SWD)
- **Available:** Annual CSA case numbers, victim gender breakdown, perpetrator gender
- **Gaps:** 
  - No publicly available breakdown by type of abuse (contact vs. non-contact)
  - Limited data on relationship between victim and perpetrator (intrafamilial vs. extrafamilial)
  - No published data on disclosure pathways
  - Limited longitudinal tracking of outcomes for victims

#### Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF)
- **Available:** Annual reported cases, victim age ranges, some perpetrator data
- **Gaps:**
  - No published data on case outcomes (prosecution, conviction, acquittal) linked to case types
  - Limited data on technology-facilitated sexual crimes against children
  - No breakdown by district/region
  - Investigation clearance rates not publicly broken down for sexual offences

#### Department of Justice (DoJ)
- **Available:** Annual charge numbers, guilty verdict rates
- **Gaps:**
  - No published data on sentencing patterns by offence type
  - No data on average time from report to prosecution
  - No published data on plea bargaining rates
  - DoJ should release more data about sexual harassment (noted by students in Google Doc)

#### Education Bureau (EDB)
- **Available:** Some data on training sessions conducted (new in TALK 2025 report)
- **Gaps:**
  - No published data on compliance rates for anti-harassment policies in schools
  - No tracking of mandatory vs. voluntary training uptake
  - No published evaluation of sex education programme effectiveness
  - No data on student complaints or disclosures within schools

#### Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC)
- **Available:** Survey data (2013, 2018, 2021); COMPASS platform; training numbers
- **Gaps:**
  - No published annual data on conciliation outcomes by sector
  - No published data on complaints received vs. investigated vs. resolved
  - No published evaluation of the COMPASS online platform effectiveness
  - EOC described as potentially "not forthcoming" (project notes)

#### University Grants Committee (UGC)
- **Gaps:**
  - No published requirement for universities to report harassment data
  - No aggregated data across UGC-funded institutions
  - No published data on mandatory vs. voluntary training at each institution

## 3. Specific Data Gaps Identified

### 3.1 No Centralised CSA Dataset
- **Problem:** Different departments (SWD, HKPF, DoJ, EDB, CSD) each collect data for different purposes with different definitions and categories
- **Impact:** No single, publicly available dataset gives a comprehensive picture of CSA in Hong Kong
- **TALK Recommendation:** Establish a public single core dataset of victims and perpetrators

### 3.2 No Prevalence Research
- **Problem:** No Hong Kong-specific, representative prevalence study on sexual harassment or CSA has been conducted
- **Impact:** Estimates rely on international studies with methodological limitations
- **TALK Recommendation:** Commission Hong Kong-specific perpetration prevalence research

### 3.3 No Data on Disclosure Barriers
- **Problem:** No local research on why victims in Hong Kong do not report
- **Impact:** Prevention programmes cannot be evidence-based without understanding local barriers
- **Related evidence:** EOC survey found 94% of university students unaware of reporting mechanisms

### 3.4 No Data on Technology-Facilitated Abuse
- **Problem:** Limited tracking of online/digital sexual harassment and abuse
- **Impact:** Voyeurism cases up 24% (2024); image-based abuse growing; AI-generated threats unaddressed
- **Related evidence:** RainLily received 646 image-based violence requests (2021-2023)

### 3.5 No Data on Education Programme Effectiveness
- **Problem:** Government does not publish evaluation data on prevention education
- **Impact:** Cannot determine if programmes work; only ~3,200 university students trained (2023)
- **Related evidence:** Sex education materials criticised as "unprofessional" and lacking consent education

### 3.6 Inconsistent Legal Definitions
- **Problem:** "Child" defined differently across ordinances (under 13, 16, 18, or 21)
- **Impact:** Data collected under different age thresholds cannot be meaningfully compared
- **Related evidence:** TALK report documents this in detail; Crimes Ordinance uses multiple age definitions

### 3.7 No Data on Perpetrator Profiles
- **Problem:** Limited publicly available data on who commits sexual offences (demographics, recidivism, pathways)
- **Impact:** Prevention strategies cannot target root causes without understanding perpetrator patterns
- **Related evidence:** Only 22% of reported perpetrators are under 16 (TALK data)

### 3.8 No Longitudinal Outcome Data
- **Problem:** No published tracking of outcomes for victims or perpetrators over time
- **Impact:** Cannot assess whether interventions work or whether victims recover
- **Related evidence:** No department publishes follow-up data

## 4. Why the Data Gap Matters

### For Prevention
- Without prevalence data, government cannot allocate resources proportionally
- Without disclosure barrier research, prevention programmes cannot be targeted
- Without education evaluation data, programmes may be ineffective or harmful (as SCMP reported)

### For Victims
- Without accessible reporting data, victims don't know their options or likely outcomes
- Without transparency on conviction rates (~6%), survivors may lose trust in the system
- Without support service data, victims cannot find help

### For Policy
- Without centralised data, lawmakers cannot make evidence-based decisions
- Without comparative data, Hong Kong cannot benchmark against international standards
- Without programme evaluation, government cannot improve its response

### For Researchers and Advocates
- TALK Hong Kong's report demonstrates the difficulty of obtaining data even through formal requests
- Researchers lack the foundational datasets needed for rigorous analysis
- Advocacy groups cannot make evidence-based arguments without data

## 5. What Needs to Change

### Immediate Actions
1. **Centralise data:** Create a single publicly accessible dataset across SWD, HKPF, DoJ, EDB, CSD
2. **Publish annually:** Require all departments to publish annual disaggregated data on sexual harassment and abuse
3. **Commission prevalence research:** Fund a Hong Kong-specific representative survey
4. **Evaluate programmes:** Publish evaluation data for EOC COMPASS, EDB sex education, and other programmes

### Medium-Term Actions
5. **Research disclosure barriers:** Fund local research on why victims don't report
6. **Track digital abuse:** Create systematic tracking of technology-facilitated sexual violence
7. **Harmonise definitions:** Align the legal definition of "child" across all ordinances
8. **Monitor mandatory reporting:** Track the impact of the 2026 Mandatory Reporting Ordinance

### Long-Term Actions
9. **Create a data hub:** Following the TALK Hong Kong model, establish a permanent data hub for CSA and sexual harassment research
10. **International benchmarking:** Regularly compare HK data with international standards and best practices
