## Key Themes Emerging from SCMP Coverage

1. **Persistent underreporting:** Whether in universities (<3% complaint rate), workplaces (most women take no action), or overall (41.4% reach police), underreporting is the dominant theme.
2. **Outdated legal framework:** Laws date back decades; no statutory definition of consent; gender-specific crimes; no persistent abuse offence for children.
3. **Inadequate education:** Government sex education materials criticised as unprofessional and victim-blaming; no consent education; only ~3,200 university students trained by EOC in 2023.
4. **Rising digital harassment:** Voyeurism up 24%; image-based abuse growing; AI-generated threats unaddressed.
5. **Child protection gap:** 29% rise in child abuse cases; mandatory reporting law only takes effect January 2026.
6. **Vulnerable workers:** Domestic helpers face systemic barriers; cases described as "rare" even when successful.
7. **Slow reform:** Law Reform Commission subcommittee established 2006; 70+ recommendations since 2019; legislation not expected until 2027.
