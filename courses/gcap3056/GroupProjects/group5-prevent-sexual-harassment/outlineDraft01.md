# Draft Report Outline v2: Closing the Data Gap on Sexual Harassment in Hong Kong

**Date:** 12 February 2026  
**Project:** Group 5 — Prevent Sexual Harassment  
**Previous version:** `outlineDraft.md`  
**Status:** Draft — for team review and refinement

## Narrowed Focus

After reviewing the TALK CSA Report (2025), SCMP coverage (2023–2026), EOC survey data, RainLily reports, and the team's Google Doc research, we propose **narrowing the focus** from the broad topic of "preventing sexual harassment" to a specific, evidence-based angle:

> **The Data Access Gap: How the lack of publicly available, centralised data on sexual harassment and sexual abuse in Hong Kong undermines prevention, accountability, and victim support — and what the government should do about it.**

### Why This Focus?

1. **Unique contribution:** No existing report (other than TALK) systematically documents the data access problem
2. **Evidence-based:** We have concrete data showing the gap (0.05% vs 8% reporting rates; data requests denied; no centralised dataset)
3. **Actionable:** Clear recommendations can be made to specific government departments
4. **Timely:** The 2026 Mandatory Reporting Ordinance will generate new data — the question is whether it will be accessible
5. **Supported by the team's hypothesis:** "Low reporting rates exist because current education programs are voluntary and social misconceptions persist"

## Title (refined)

**"Breaking the Silence with Data: Why Hong Kong Needs Transparent, Centralised Data on Sexual Harassment to Protect Its Citizens"**

*Alternative titles:*
- "The Data Gap: What Hong Kong Doesn't Know About Sexual Harassment — And Why It Matters"
- "From 0.05% to 8%: Closing Hong Kong's Sexual Harassment Data Access Gap"

---

## Executive Summary
- Hong Kong has no centralised, publicly accessible dataset on sexual harassment or sexual abuse
- The official CSA reporting rate (0.05%) is 160 times lower than the estimated global rate (8%)
- Government departments collect data for their own operational purposes but do not share it
- Prevention programmes cannot be evidence-based without accessible data
- The 2026 Mandatory Reporting Ordinance creates an opportunity to build a transparent data system
- We recommend: centralised data, annual publication, prevalence research, programme evaluation

## 1. Introduction: The Problem We Don't Measure

- Sexual harassment and sexual abuse are significant problems in Hong Kong
- 23% of university students harassed (EOC 2018); 34% of working women harassed (2025 survey)
- TALK Hong Kong estimates 16% of the population has experienced CSA
- Yet: official reporting rate is 0.05%; conviction rate ~6%; most victims never seek help
- **The core issue:** We cannot solve a problem we don't measure

---

## 2. Background: What We Know (And How We Know It)

### 2.1 Prevalence Estimates
- CSA prevalence: 16% (TALK 2025) — 20% female, 11% male
- Unreported cases: up to 96%
- University harassment: 23% prevalence, <3% file complaints (EOC 2018)
- Workplace harassment: 34% of women (2025)
- Sexual assault reaching police: 41.4% (SCMP 2025)

### 2.2 Government Response Landscape
- EOC: conciliation, COMPASS platform, training (only ~3,200 university students in 2023)
- EDB: school policies (compliance not monitored); sex education criticised as "unprofessional"
- DoJ: law reform consultation (legislation by 2027); no statutory consent definition
- SWD: child protection; Mandatory Reporting Ordinance (effective Jan 2026)
- HKPF: investigations; 29% rise in child abuse cases (2023)

### 2.3 Civil Society Efforts
- TALK Hong Kong: CSA data report (first of its kind in HK)
- RainLily: crisis support, image-based violence (646 requests, 1,342 photos removed)
- EOC surveys: key data source, but not systematic or annual

## 3. The Data Gap: What's Missing

### 3.1 No Centralised Dataset
- Each department (SWD, HKPF, DoJ, EDB, CSD) collects data in silos
- Different definitions, categories, and age thresholds
- No public, unified view of sexual harassment/abuse across the system

### 3.2 Data Requested but Not Provided
- TALK Hong Kong documented systematic data requests and what was denied
- Education Bureau compliance data not published
- EOC conciliation outcomes not disaggregated by sector
- DoJ sentencing patterns not published by offence type

### 3.3 No Prevalence Research
- No HK-specific representative survey on sexual harassment or CSA
- Estimates depend on international studies with methodological limitations

### 3.4 No Evaluation of Programmes
- EOC COMPASS platform: no published effectiveness data
- EDB sex education: criticised but no evaluation published
- University training: voluntary, low uptake, no outcomes data

### 3.5 No Disclosure Barrier Research
- No local research on why HK victims don't report
- 94% of university students unaware of reporting mechanisms (EOC)

### 3.6 Emerging Digital Threats Untracked
- Voyeurism up 24% (2024); AI-generated CSAM unaddressed
- No systematic tracking of technology-facilitated sexual violence

## 4. Why the Data Gap Matters

### 4.1 For Prevention
- Cannot target programmes without knowing prevalence and barriers
- Cannot allocate resources proportionally without data

### 4.2 For Victims
- 41.4% of sexual assault cases reach police; only 6% result in conviction
- Victims wait 4+ years to seek help — transparency could build trust

### 4.3 For Policy and Lawmakers
- Law reform consultation underway — but without data, reform is based on assumptions
- Mandatory Reporting Ordinance (2026) will generate data — but will it be accessible?

### 4.4 For Researchers and Advocates
- TALK Hong Kong had to create its own data hub because government data was inaccessible
- Advocacy groups cannot make evidence-based arguments without data

## 5. Government's Response to Our Enquiries
*[Placeholder — to be updated based on Code on Access to Information requests]*

### Questions Submitted
- See `govEnquiries.md` for full list of questions to each department
- Key departments: EOC, EDB, DoJ/LRC, SWD, Security Bureau, UGC

### Anticipated Responses
- Departments may cite privacy, operational constraints, or resource limitations
- Some data may be provided in aggregate but not disaggregated
- Comparison with international Freedom of Information regimes would be instructive

## 6. Recommendations

### Immediate (2026)
1. **Centralise data:** Establish a publicly accessible, cross-departmental dataset on sexual harassment/abuse
2. **Publish annual reports:** Require SWD, HKPF, DoJ, EDB, CSD to publish annual disaggregated data
3. **Evaluate programmes:** Publish effectiveness data for EOC COMPASS, EDB sex education, and training

### Short-Term (2026–2027)
4. **Commission prevalence research:** Fund a HK-specific representative survey
5. **Research disclosure barriers:** Understand why victims don't report in the HK context
6. **Monitor mandatory reporting:** Track and publish data from the 2026 ordinance implementation
7. **Improve sex education:** Address consent, victim-blaming, and digital safety

### Long-Term (2027+)
8. **Create a permanent data hub:** Following the TALK HK model
9. **Harmonise legal definitions:** Align the definition of "child" across ordinances
10. **International benchmarking:** Regularly compare with UK, Australia, Singapore standards

## 7. Media Investigation Angle

**Proposed angle:** "The Numbers That Don't Exist: How Hong Kong's Data Blindspot on Sexual Harassment Fails Victims"

- Lead with the 0.05% vs 8% reporting rate comparison
- Show specific data requests denied to TALK Hong Kong
- Interview TALK, RainLily, EOC
- Use university training data (3,200 out of 300,000+ students) as illustrative case
- Link to mandatory reporting law: will the new data be accessible?
- Letter to the editor / op-ed potential: "From 0.05% to 8% — closing Hong Kong's data gap"
