### Misconceptions About Sexual Violence
- Common myth: People being assaulted tend to resist
- Reality: Victims are more likely to be shocked, afraid, and "frozen"
- These misconceptions affect investigators, judicial officers, legal practitioners, and jurors

### Underreporting
- Research shows most cases of sexual harassment go unreported
- Reasons include: fear of retaliation, stigma, lack of trust in reporting systems
- Awareness campaigns are crucial to encourage victims and witnesses to speak up
