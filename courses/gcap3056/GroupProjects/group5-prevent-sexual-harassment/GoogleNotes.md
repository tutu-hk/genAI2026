### Team Members
- **LEUNG King Kai Kenneth** — kennethlpersonal@gmail.com
- **SOJOBI Akpevwe Joyce** — joycesojobi@gmail.com

### Direction
- Increase public awareness of underreporting on SA
- Suggest to roll out education campaigns on sexual harassment, abuse and assault
- Suggest to provide more support on victims before, during and after trial

### Title
**Creating Awareness to Prevent Sexual Harassment Effectively in Our Community**

### Sources Documented

#### Kenneth's Contributions

**Source 1: LegCo Panel on Constitutional Affairs — EOC Briefing (2024)**
- **URL:** [LegCo Paper ca20240520cb2-634-3-e](https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2024/english/panels/ca/papers/ca20240520cb2-634-3-e.pdf)
- **Fact:** At most, only around 3,000 university students and staff have taken in-person training sessions for sexual harassment. For scale, HKBU's undergraduate degree has enrollment of 7,442.
- **Question:** Not many university students have enrolled in sexual harassment education programs voluntarily. Should it be mandatory?
- **Excerpt (p.4):** "In 2023, 51 in-person training sessions were conducted with approximately 3,200 participating students and staff members. In the first quarter of 2024, 14 in-person training sessions were conducted with approximately 1,200 participating students and staff members."

- **Fact:** There are many misconceptions about sexual harassment/assault. It is widely believed people being assaulted resist, but they are more likely to be shocked, afraid and "frozen."
- **Question:** What more could we do to break the social stigma on sexual harassment, abuse and assault?
- **Excerpt (p.38):** "The ambiguities in current sexual offence laws not only allow societal misconceptions and stereotypes about sexual violence to perpetuate in criminal judicial procedures, but also severely hinder sexual violence survivors from seeking justice."

#### Joyce's Contributions

**Source: UN Women — Creating Safe Public Spaces**
- **URL:** UN Women (asiapacific.unwomen.org via Bing)
- **Fact 1 — Prevalence:** Research shows several occurrences of sexual harassment among women and men in public spaces or workplaces, at least once or more in their life.
- **Fact 2 — Creating awareness programs:** Having workshops, school programs or seminars to enlighten the public on how to report incidents.
- **Excerpt:** "Underreporting is widespread: Research shows that most cases of sexual harassment go unreported due to fear of retaliation, stigma, or lack of trust in reporting systems."
- **Note:** "I use AI" (declared)

## Tab: A — Week 4 (Progress)

### Key Actions
- Check useful information at: [GitHub group5 folder](https://github.com/tesolchina/genAI2026/tree/main/courses/gcap3056/group5-prevent-sexual-harassment)
- **Requesting info from:** EDB, DOJ (Joyce); UGC, Security Bureau (Kenneth)

### Planned Work
1. Critical review of current government mechanisms (Joyce) — How do they handle complaints? How many datasets provided?
2. Analysis of current information from different departments — potentially with Python or IDE
3. Drafting government inquiry emails (Tuesday meetup)
4. Expected outcome, follow-up measures

---

## Tab: A — Week 5

- Need to send info requests to the government

---

## Tab: B — Task 3 (Site-Specific Search & Curation)

### Task 3.1: Google Site-Specific Search

**Kenneth searched:**
- `sexual assault site:rainlily.org.hk`
- `sexual harassment site:rainlily.org.hk`
- `sexual assault site:legco.gov.hk`
- `sexual harassment site:legco.gov.hk`

**Kenneth's reflection:**
- RainLily has useful titles; LegCo has a lot of info to go through
- Searched LegCo to know the progress on necessary legislation

### Task 3.2: Curating Publicly Available Information
- Done in "A — Week 3" section

---

## Tab: B — Task 4

### Task 4.1: Review AI Web Search Results
- Each team should have a `WebSearchReport.md`
- Reference: [GitHub WebSearchReport](https://github.com/tesolchina/genAI2026/blob/main/courses/gcap3056/group1-legco-data-access/WebSearchReport.md)
- Process documented in [process.log](https://github.com/tesolchina/genAI2026/blob/main/courses/gcap3056/ProjectMetaDirector/process.log)

### Task 4.2: Review Plan to Request Information from Government
- Study the process and provide feedback

### Task 4.3: Review and Explore AI Agent in IDE
- Introduced tools for hands-on experience

## Tab: Government Questions

### Joyce's Questions (SOJOBI Akpevwe Joyce)

1. **Law enforcement data:** How many sexual harassment cases have been reported to law enforcement over the past five years, and what proportion resulted in prosecution, conviction, or dismissal?
2. **Workplace complaints data:** What are the annual statistics on sexual harassment complaints filed with labour departments or workplace safety agencies, disaggregated by industry, gender, and outcome?
3. **For EDB:** How does EDB monitor and regulate contents provided by educational institutions and external NGOs/religious organizations in "sexuality education" workshops to ensure materials do not violate the Sex Discrimination Ordinance?
4. **For EDB:** Will EDB implement a mandatory, centralized reporting mechanism for all substantiated sexual harassment cases (anonymized) to track trends and identify "high-risk" institutional cultures?

**Note:** "I use AI" (declared)

### Kenneth's Questions (LEUNG King Kai Kenneth)

1. **For Security Bureau / Law Reform Commission:**
   - What is the specific timeline to codify a clearer definition of 'consent' that explicitly accounts for 'tonic immobility' (the 'frozen' response)?
   - What measures are being taken for mandatory training of Judiciary and HKPF to prevent misconceptions about victim resistance?

2. **For Social Welfare Department / Security Bureau:**
   - How does SWD plan to refine the 'Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill' to include specific protocols for identifying non-physical indicators of sexual abuse?
   - Will the government commit to publishing an annual, comprehensive dataset specifically for CSA cases differentiating between familial and extra-familial perpetrators?

3. **For University Grants Committee (UGC):**
   - Will UGC consider making 'Anti-Sexual Harassment and Consent Training' a mandatory, credit-bearing requirement for graduation across all UGC-funded institutions?
   - What additional recurrent funding will be allocated to EOC's Anti-Sexual Harassment Unit (ASHU)?

**Note:** Compiled with Gemini from own analysis and provided sources (declared)

## Tab: Government Request

### Plan
- Consolidate individual questions into one formal request
- Every team member contributes to drafting
- Clearly state requesting specific data/documents not currently public
- Draft the letter using the **Code on Access to Information**

---

## Tab: Document Hypothesis

### Draft Hypothesis
> "We believe low reporting rates for sexual assault and harassment exist because current education programs are voluntary and social misconceptions (the 'frozen' response) persist, and we recommend making sexual harassment training mandatory in tertiary institutions and launching targeted public awareness campaigns to debunk myths."

3. **Team Collaboration** — How the team created value with different contributions

---

## Tab: LegCo Report (Draft Outline)

### Title
**Breaking the Silence: How Government Programmes Can Better Prevent Sexual Harassment in Hong Kong**

### Key Points
- Despite legislative reforms (Sexual Offences law reform 2024), government programmes remain fragmented
- Low awareness and participation, especially among young people
- DOJ should release more data about sexual harassment

### Hypotheses
1. Government anti-sexual harassment education programmes not reaching enough people, especially university students and young workers
2. EOC's communication and outreach needs significant improvement
3. Gap between law reform and public understanding

### Questions to Explore
- How many people has EOC's programme reached?
- What budget is allocated to sexual harassment prevention education?
- How does EOC measure effectiveness?
- What has changed since the 2024 law reform?
