## Research Questions to Consider

As you curate information, think about:

1. **Current State**
   - What does the program do currently?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - What resources are allocated?

2. **Effectiveness**
   - Is the program achieving its goals?
   - What do users/citizens say about it?
   - Are there any audit reports or reviews?

3. **Comparison**
   - How does it compare to similar programs elsewhere?
   - What best practices exist internationally?

4. **Improvement**
   - What gaps or issues have been identified?
   - What recommendations have been made?
   - What could be done better?

---

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Working as a Team

1. **Divide the work** - Each member finds 2-3 sources
2. **Avoid duplication** - Coordinate to cover different aspects
3. **Share findings** - Add to the shared Google Doc
4. **Review each other's work** - Provide feedback and questions

### Communication

- Use the Google Doc comments to discuss findings
- Tag team members when you find related information
- Flag any contradictory information for discussion

---

## Submission Requirements

### First Reply (In-class, 29 Jan - Week 3)

Post to the Moodle forum:

### Edit and Update (Around Week 5)

Return to update your post with:

## Step 2: Formulate Hypotheses

After collecting information, your group should discuss:

| Question | Your Group's Response |
|----------|----------------------|
| What could be the area for improvement? | |
| How can the government do a better job? | |

Create a new tab in your Google Doc to record these hypotheses.
