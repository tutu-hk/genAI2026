**Week 3 | 29 January 2026**  
**Type:** Learn and Reflect  
**Moodle Forum:** [Google site specific search](https://buelearning.hkbu.edu.hk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=347869)

---

## Overview

This task introduces a powerful research technique: **Google site-specific search**. This is a valuable skill for researching government programs and policies, as it allows you to find information within specific domains.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this task, you will:
1. Learn how to use Google's site-specific search operators
2. Practice finding information from government sources
3. Develop skills for verifying claims with primary sources
4. Reflect on the usefulness of this technique

---

## The Technique: Site-Specific Search

### Basic Syntax

```
site:domain.com search terms
```

### Examples

| Search Query | What It Does |
|--------------|--------------|
| `site:gov.hk emergency alert` | Search only gov.hk for "emergency alert" |
| `site:legco.gov.hk fire services` | Search LegCo website for fire services info |
| `site:csb.gov.hk vacancies` | Search Civil Service Bureau for vacancies |
| `site:ogcio.gov.hk digital services` | Search OGCIO for digital services info |

### Why Is This Useful?

- **Find primary sources** - Get information directly from official government websites
- **Verify claims** - Check if statements in news articles match official records
- **Discover hidden data** - Find PDFs, reports, and documents not easily navigable
- **Filter out noise** - Exclude unreliable or irrelevant sources

## Case Study: Emergency Alert System

Consider this excerpt from SCMP:

> "While the Finance Committee was told that the old system was used 12 times in the 12 months to February 2020, the lawmakers were perhaps not fully informed about the total usage of the system."

**Challenge:** How can we verify "the old system was used 12 times in the 12 months to February 2020"?

### Approach

1. Use `site:legco.gov.hk emergency alert system` to find Finance Committee papers
2. Look for PDF documents with usage statistics
3. Cross-reference with Code on Access to Information responses

## Your Task

### Step 1: Practice the Technique

Choose a topic related to your group project and perform site-specific searches:

| Your Group | Suggested Searches |
|------------|-------------------|
| Group 1 (Legco Data) | `site:legco.gov.hk open data` |
| Group 2 (Fire Services) | `site:hkfsd.gov.hk fire safety` |
| Group 3 (Government App) | `site:csb.gov.hk mobile app` |
| Group 4 (Fire Services) | `site:hkfsd.gov.hk accountability` |
| Group 5 (Sexual Harassment) | `site:eoc.org.hk harassment` |
| Group 6 (Rare Disease) | `site:ha.org.hk rare disease` |

### Step 2: Document Your Findings

For each search, record:

| Field | Your Response |
|-------|---------------|
| Search query used | |
| Number of results | |
| Most useful result found | |
| URL of the source | |
| Key fact discovered | |

### Step 3: Reflect

Answer these questions in your Moodle forum reply:

1. What did you search for and why?
2. What useful information did you find?
3. How might this technique help with your group project?
4. What limitations did you encounter?

## Tips for Effective Searching

### Advanced Operators

| Operator | Example | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `site:` | `site:gov.hk` | Limit to a domain |
| `filetype:` | `filetype:pdf budget` | Find specific file types |
| `intitle:` | `intitle:annual report` | Search in page titles |
| `"exact phrase"` | `"fire services department"` | Exact match |
| `-exclude` | `site:gov.hk -legco` | Exclude terms |

### Combining Operators

```
site:gov.hk filetype:pdf "annual report" 2024
```
This finds PDF annual reports from 2024 on gov.hk sites.
