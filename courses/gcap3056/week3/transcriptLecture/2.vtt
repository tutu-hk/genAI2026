00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:22.470
Simon Wang: Well, because some of you are not in class, maybe you will review the video. I will make the video recording available. I don't think I will upload it to YouTube, because in the video, there's actually some personal information. Let me try it, maybe I just give you a link on Zoom or something.

2
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.010
Simon Wang: But anyway, what you need to do today…

3
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.420
Simon Wang: in week three, is to, work on two… task.

4
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.070
Simon Wang: And the first one is right here, which is ModelTask 3.1.

5
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.129
Simon Wang: To learn and reflect.

6
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.530
Simon Wang: And,

7
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:59.470
Simon Wang: You know, let me kind of take a back… a step back. I want to explain a little bit, you know, my, teaching philosophy, or kind of how I understand learning. So, learning…

8
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.149
Simon Wang: it could be knowledge, right? It could be some new knowledge you gain. But, another way to think about learning is sort of the long-term change in behaviors.

9
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:24.590
Simon Wang: Right? So it's not just about what you know, it's not about the new information you get from a course, it's more about how your behavior will change after you take a course.

10
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.389
Simon Wang: So, in this case.

11
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.980
Simon Wang: Presumably most of you, when you search for Google, you just do a general search, right?

12
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:48.869
Simon Wang: But, after today's class, next time when you search Google, you will put this site, then whatever domain, on your search term, and then you will be able to search for a specific site. And that would be a change in behavior.

13
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:59.140
Simon Wang: Right? And that change… changing behavior will lead to more productivity, right? You will be able to get more precise information from a specific website.

14
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.250
Simon Wang: And hopefully that's useful. That's useful for you as a knowledge worker in whatever task that you're going to work on in future.

15
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.940
Simon Wang: So that's the point, right? That's why we're doing this.

16
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.930
Simon Wang: No.

17
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:21.289
Simon Wang: I need evidence, right? We all need evidence about the learning outcome. That's why, at some point, you have to write some learning journals to…

18
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:39.340
Simon Wang: kind of reflect on your learning, and based on my understanding of learning, in your journal entries, you should explain and describe how, in this case, this Google site-specific search would, you know, would change your behavior.

19
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.010
Simon Wang: And how you will become a more productive knowledge worker because of this technique.

20
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:59.520
Simon Wang: Well, I'm not saying that this technique itself will make a world of difference. It could be just a very tiny thing, right? It's a little thing. But that's a small step towards a more productive life, hopefully.

21
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.770
Simon Wang: So… when you…

22
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:17.319
Simon Wang: when you reply here, I'm looking for some kind of narrative, not just one line or… a few words.

23
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.799
Simon Wang: But, but, it, it can be a… a case study.

24
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.740
Simon Wang: Right?

25
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:35.619
Simon Wang: Well, at the very minimum, what you can do is go to your reply, and then try to find that Legislative Council document, which I have already found.

26
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.259
Simon Wang: So… I won't give you the link.

27
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.740
Simon Wang: But you need to go find this document that gives the information

28
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.120
Simon Wang: That provided information about emergency alert system.

29
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.609
Simon Wang: Right? Which I believe should be quite straightforward.

30
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.709
Simon Wang: But I'm talking about here, I'm talking about this… this piece of information.

31
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:10.599
Simon Wang: So, in order to kind of demonstrate that you have already learned this technique, you need to find this information in the Legislative Council website, and then provide a link.

32
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:24.930
Simon Wang: Okay? So that's one thing, and then you can very briefly describe how you did that, you know, you go to Google, and you search for emergency alert system, put the quotation marks around emergency alert system, and then site.

33
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:33.049
Simon Wang: L-E-G-C-O dot GOV dot HK, and then there are, you know, 4 pages of results, and you find that document

34
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:43.679
Simon Wang: having this information. So that's the practice which I demonstrated in class, and you can try to do it again to replicate what I did.

35
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.060
Simon Wang: Which is to imitate, right? Watch and learn.

36
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:58.099
Simon Wang: Now, you need to reply that information. I mean, you can copy other people's work, but I want you to try it yourself to experience firsthand.

37
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.550
Simon Wang: But then, you need to apply this technique to your own project.

38
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:15.939
Simon Wang: Right? So, for example, there's one team working on government vacancies, then you can say, okay, government vacancies, put quotation mark around it, and then maybe app, and then site.

39
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.099
Simon Wang: gov.hk, right? And see if you'll be able to find some information there.

40
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.170
Simon Wang: So you see, government vacancies put collision mark, and then site

41
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.159
Simon Wang: gov.hk, so that's actually a broader, search.

42
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.879
Simon Wang: Okay, so then you will be able to find some…

43
00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:00.950
Simon Wang: pages, actually quite a… quite a number of pages, and see whether you're able to find something. And you can compare this with

44
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:08.250
Simon Wang: What if you don't have that? Simply government… vacancies, then…

45
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.689
Simon Wang: I think there will be more results, okay?

46
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.530
Simon Wang: And what if you put… Scmp.

47
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:30.210
Simon Wang: And when you put… Smp, you see there's really not that many pages.

48
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.370
Simon Wang: Right?

49
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.399
Simon Wang: Plus, it's… it's not even necessary about the app, so maybe you put the app here.

50
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:45.960
Simon Wang: Okay, so you try different, search terms, different sites, and see whether you will find something more useful.

51
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:54.859
Simon Wang: And once you use this approach to find something useful for your project, then you can write about it in your reply.

52
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.210
Simon Wang: Okay?

53
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.860
Simon Wang: So, you can reply and describe

54
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.940
Simon Wang: You know, how, how this is a good or useful experience for you.

55
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:19.520
Simon Wang: Later on, I will curate all your replies from the Moodle and give it, all the replies in the file, and then you can use that file to write your reflective learning journals.

56
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:28.109
Simon Wang: Okay? So, so, everything you write, put in a Moodle, it will become your first draft for your reflective learning journal.

57
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.049
Simon Wang: Okay, if you make more efforts now.

58
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.300
Simon Wang: Your life will be easier later on.

59
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.680
Simon Wang: Okay.

60
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.570
Simon Wang: I hope that makes sense.

61
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.840
Simon Wang: Now, the second task…

62
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:55.190
Simon Wang: The second task is about, curating public Publicly available information.

63
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:10.300
Simon Wang: what you need to do is actually to actually go to that Google Docs assigned to your group, right? Every group has got a Google Docs.

64
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.520
Simon Wang: Here.

65
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:24.120
Simon Wang: So you go to the link, and you start, creating some tables, Right?

66
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.959
Simon Wang: And, it would be useful if you can turn this into…

67
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:39.550
Simon Wang: some heading, like heading 3. So, why do you want to format it this way? Because once you have the heading.

68
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.209
Simon Wang: Then you will be able to get a link specific

69
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.199
Simon Wang: to this heading. Okay, let me, let me show you.

70
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.330
Simon Wang: Cuz…

71
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.010
Simon Wang: So, for example, here… because…

72
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.789
Simon Wang: Because we have this,

73
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.489
Simon Wang: Heading, you know, it's… it's a, it's a level 4, whatever.

74
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.660
Simon Wang: you see there's a tab here, and there's a heading here. So this URL will…

75
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.529
Simon Wang: We'll lead you strict to this particular A section of the page.

76
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:44.990
Simon Wang: Okay, so I think that's very useful. Now, once you edited this table, you can put the table… you can put the link in Moodle, and then you can just write a few words and say, I found this piece of information.

77
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:54.089
Simon Wang: And, I used whatever skills to do that, and more importantly, what insights I have gained from this piece of document.

78
00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:12.529
Simon Wang: Because everybody can do Google search, right? Everybody can find some documents online. What you can learn from this course is how you can start asking critical questions about that piece of information, which then leads you to,

79
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.529
Simon Wang: Ask more questions for the government staff to answer.

80
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.230
Simon Wang: So, which is the next step?

81
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.000
Simon Wang: Okay?

82
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.260
Simon Wang: So, that's why…

83
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:31.520
Simon Wang: when you work on task number 2 in Moodle here, you need to reflect on the process of critical review.

84
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.720
Simon Wang: dumb…

85
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:40.509
Simon Wang: you know, publicly available information. But, for now, you can simply follow the instructions here, which is…

86
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.770
Simon Wang: To document what information you have found and what insights you have gained.

87
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.169
Simon Wang: Okay, I think, I think it's pretty…

88
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.400
Simon Wang: Pretty clear in terms of what you need to do.

89
00:10:51.270 --> 00:11:00.829
Simon Wang: If you're not sure, you can wait a bit, you can see how other people are doing things, and then you can, you can learn from them. We can learn from one another.

90
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.760
Simon Wang: Okay?

91
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:14.879
Simon Wang: So, I hope, it makes sense, and, I will also, start looking at your projects, because…

92
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:25.639
Simon Wang: you know, obviously I'm more experienced on doing these kind of things. I've been doing these things for many years, so I will give you some suggestions and feedback.

93
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:36.260
Simon Wang: As you, you know, get more information, first round of information curation, Okay, and yeah.

94
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:49.340
Simon Wang: So maybe you guys can spend another, I don't know, 5 minutes or 10 minutes working on this, and then I will start talking about AI Agent.

95
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.629
Simon Wang: Which I think, it's, super, super exciting.
