1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.550
Simon Wang: Alright, so,

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.649
Simon Wang: To follow up what we discussed in the last two weeks, I just want to kind of reiterate our goal

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.710
Simon Wang: Our goal is to… So, we put a word here. What is the word?

4
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:30.569
Simon Wang: Review a government program and make recommendations on how they can blah blah blah. So… What do you think?

5
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.760
Simon Wang: What is the goal here?

6
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.319
Simon Wang: Is to… what is the word?

7
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.699
Simon Wang: Yes, critically review, okay?

8
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.069
Simon Wang: So that's a very important word to keep in mind. We don't just…

9
00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:02.359
Simon Wang: review a government program, we critically review. That means we, assume that the government's program has something

10
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.649
Simon Wang: Wrong, or it's got room for improvement.

11
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.489
Simon Wang: Okay? I think it's safe to assume that a government program always got room for improvement.

12
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.879
Simon Wang: A second point I want to make here is that, we're looking at a program.

13
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.379
Simon Wang: not policy, okay? Because policy can be very broad, right? Like, one country, two systems could be a policy.

14
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.830
Simon Wang: Or the government has the policy to develop the city into an education hub.

15
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.640
Simon Wang: That's a policy. That's a direction.

16
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:43.539
Simon Wang: But that's not something concrete or specific. We don't have the time and the resources to review a policy. That's too much. We are looking at something more concrete.

17
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.409
Simon Wang: So that's something you have to remember.

18
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.560
Simon Wang: Okay?

19
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.830
Simon Wang: But then there's another blank.

20
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.829
Simon Wang: To clinically review a government program and make recommendations on how they can…

21
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.110
Simon Wang: Yeah, how they can do a better job, right? How they can serve the people better.

22
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:28.689
Simon Wang: All right? So I hope you can recognize there's a, you know, potential of this course, that our project may become something useful for our society. That might be a good reason for you to spend a little bit more time on this course.

23
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.460
Simon Wang: Yeah, so… so we want to look at something more concrete.

24
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.550
Simon Wang: A program has got some specific goals.

25
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.899
Simon Wang: With funding support, right? So…

26
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.470
Simon Wang: You know, one of the, kind of, things that we want to look at is how much money has been, spent on this program.

27
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.470
Simon Wang: Right? Because when you look at… when you follow the money, look at the figure, then you can do simple math.

28
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:04.619
Simon Wang: And see how many people have benefited from it, and then, on average, what's the cost per capita, or per person?

29
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.830
Simon Wang: You know, sometimes when you do that math, immediately you see the problem, right? So maybe the program is pretty good, but…

30
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.479
Simon Wang: Not enough people have joined it.

31
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.950
Simon Wang: Okay, that thing in itself is a huge problem.

32
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:26.109
Simon Wang: Okay? So that's why we want to follow the money. We want to look at how much money has been allocated for that particular program.

33
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:42.469
Simon Wang: But it's not always easy, right? Because sometimes the department has got a budget for a couple of different things, so it may not be straightforward to actually kind of allocate to specifically locate a figure for a program.

34
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.420
Simon Wang: Okay.

35
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.230
Simon Wang: Alright? But that's something we need to keep in mind.

36
00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:01.609
Simon Wang: Now, when we, start doing our project, hopefully by today, we form all the groups, and we select all the topics, and we start working on the project.

37
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.089
Simon Wang: The very first step is to look at what information is publicly available.

38
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.290
Simon Wang: Alright.

39
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.930
Simon Wang: So, what information is probably available?

40
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.859
Simon Wang: And, obviously, you can search in the internet, you can go to Google, or Bing, or whatever search engine, and you can start.

41
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.520
Simon Wang: put in some keywords, including Hong Kong or Hong Kong government, then you will get some, web pages.

42
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.210
Simon Wang: And that can be useful.

43
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.450
Simon Wang: But today, we're going to learn something… Hopefully, it's new to you.

44
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.530
Simon Wang: But, you know, I think,

45
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.100
Simon Wang: I think you should, you should, you should know this.

46
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.300
Simon Wang: Which is… what do we call Google Site-specific search.

47
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.400
Simon Wang: Okay?

48
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.409
Simon Wang: So, what is Google's site-specific search?

49
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.040
Simon Wang: If you go to Google.

50
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.059
Simon Wang: What you will get…

51
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.110
Simon Wang: It's basically… The result of the entire internet.

52
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.559
Simon Wang: For example, when you search Emergency Alert System.

53
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.290
Simon Wang: The first page you got is actually…

54
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.410
Simon Wang: the off-car page on Emergency Law System in Hong Kong.

55
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.540
Simon Wang: Okay?

56
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:43.299
Simon Wang: But this may or may not be very useful, because it's very general, right? So Google would return any results on emergency alert system

57
00:05:43.440 --> 00:06:01.749
Simon Wang: That they can find on the internet. Of course, they have their own algorithm to rank the pages, and hopefully they will give us something that's relevant, relevant to the visitors. And of course, I log in, so Google actually knows a little bit about me, they know I'm from Hong Kong, I'm currently in Hong Kong, that's why they put

58
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.560
Simon Wang: The Hong Kong webpage.

59
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.730
Simon Wang: at the top.

60
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.630
Simon Wang: Right?

61
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.140
Simon Wang: But what if we, want something more specific?

62
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.920
Simon Wang: So, the trick is to… Put this site.

63
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.049
Simon Wang: Okay, so there's the word sight.

64
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.120
Simon Wang: And then column, And after that, you need to…

65
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.340
Simon Wang: put a specific domain, for example.

66
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.169
Simon Wang: One of the websites we go to a lot in this course is the Legislative Council website.

67
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:44.160
Simon Wang: So the Legislative Council website is leggco.gov.hk.

68
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.610
Simon Wang: Okay?

69
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.389
Simon Wang: So, of course, you can, you can visit this website.

70
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.610
Simon Wang: And, you will go to the official website of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.

71
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.880
Simon Wang: But then what you can also do is to put site column, And then let go.

72
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.499
Simon Wang: Okay? But make sure that you don't have the HTTP…

73
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.169
Simon Wang: HTTPs or whatever, just, domain.

74
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.570
Simon Wang: Okay, so this is the trick.

75
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.490
Simon Wang: Does it make sense?

76
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:25.459
Simon Wang: You put whatever you want to search, the search term, and then site, column, and then the domain.

77
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.120
Simon Wang: When you search for this, Okay, when you search for this.

78
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:37.450
Simon Wang: the Google will only… the search engine will only return webpages from this particular domain.

79
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.370
Simon Wang: Okay?

80
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:48.410
Simon Wang: So, as you can see here, when I, do this search.

81
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.520
Simon Wang: I got a much more focused

82
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.389
Simon Wang: Results, although there's still, a lot of results.

83
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.510
Simon Wang: But you can see every single result.

84
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.520
Simon Wang: is from… the Legislative Console website.

85
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.319
Simon Wang: But… Still, there are a lot of, Pages.

86
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:20.189
Simon Wang: Now, here's the question. What if I want to be more precise? I just want…

87
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.930
Simon Wang: Emergency alert system. Pages on emergency alert system. What can I do?

88
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.150
Simon Wang: Exactly.

89
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:39.190
Simon Wang: So, we could put quotation, and I don't know whether it's case sensitive. Let's just see how it would work out. So, when you put quotation around.

90
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.799
Simon Wang: And in the site, you will get much more precise results.

91
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.420
Simon Wang: Okay?

92
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.699
Simon Wang: Now, this time, you see, all the documents

93
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.399
Simon Wang: And see, this is much more precise. Now we only got 4 pages.

94
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.660
Simon Wang: Okay?

95
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.709
Simon Wang: So that's much more manageable.

96
00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.179
Simon Wang: then, you know, many, many pages.

97
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:09.810
Simon Wang: Now, this is actually… Leads to a good…

98
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.779
Simon Wang: kind of success story, I would argue.

99
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.310
Simon Wang: Where's my Google Docs?

100
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:20.810
Simon Wang: Okay, here we go.

101
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.069
Simon Wang: Because… This is a letter.

102
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.079
Simon Wang: that I published.

103
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.140
Simon Wang: I don't remember, it's my publication or my student's publication.

104
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.030
Simon Wang: It's talking about, emergency alert system.

105
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:50.310
Simon Wang: While the Finance Committee was told that the old system was used 12 times in the 12 months.

106
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:58.900
Simon Wang: to February 2020, The lawmakers were perhaps not fully informed about the total usage of the system.

107
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:08.189
Simon Wang: According to the government response to our inquiry under the Code on Access to Information, the government used SMS to disseminate the message 13 times.

108
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:14.049
Simon Wang: From 2019 to 2020, and 12 times from 2029 to…

109
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.800
Simon Wang: 2010, the system was used only once seen.

110
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:25.310
Simon Wang: 2021. Now, let's not worry about the second part, you know, codon accessing information is something we can talk about next week.

111
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:32.169
Simon Wang: I just want to point out that this particular piece of information, which is the system, the old system.

112
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.889
Simon Wang: Was used 12 times in a…

113
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.880
Simon Wang: 12 months to February 2020, this piece of information, you can't really find it online. I mean, you can't find it on newspaper coverage.

114
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.660
Simon Wang: Okay.

115
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.469
Simon Wang: So, the challenge would be, how can you find this piece of information?

116
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:57.939
Simon Wang: Well, in case you want to know where it has come from, let me…

117
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.990
Simon Wang: Let me see if I can quickly,

118
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.759
Simon Wang: So, so this is, this is the, the letter that,

119
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.630
Simon Wang: My students publish in 2023.

120
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.060
Simon Wang: It's, 3… 3 years ago.

121
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.350
Simon Wang: Okay, two of my students.

122
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.520
Simon Wang: Nope.

123
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.830
Simon Wang: My point is…

124
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:56.570
Simon Wang: Well, my point is, this piece of information we found it… through the Legislative Council, Site-specific search.

125
00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:04.680
Simon Wang: Okay So, if you go back to… Here… Okay?

126
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.430
Simon Wang: Let me see if I can quickly locate this piece. Yeah, I think it's right here.

127
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.590
Simon Wang: So this document… Okay?

128
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.050
Simon Wang: 2020.

129
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:28.819
Simon Wang: And, this is a document that the government is trying to apply for 30 billion Hong Kong dollars.

130
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.899
Simon Wang: For the pandemic.

131
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.569
Simon Wang: Okay? Anti-epid… Epidemic Fund.

132
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.349
Simon Wang: Now, in this document, if you search for alert system.

133
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:53.279
Simon Wang: You can see that among all the Items being applied funding for?

134
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.709
Simon Wang: Emergency alert system is one of them.

135
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.910
Simon Wang: Okay?

136
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.310
Simon Wang: And this is where… We find this piece of information.

137
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.419
Simon Wang: In the last 12 months, the government used this mode of message dissemination 12 times.

138
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.570
Simon Wang: But I think this document is completely misleading.

139
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.790
Simon Wang: Because they didn't mention… the past…

140
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.929
Simon Wang: 12 mid-years. They only talk about 12 months.

141
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.770
Simon Wang: Is that me?

142
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:35.440
Simon Wang: But, if you want to do research on projects like this, You need to… Locate this document, right?

143
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.409
Simon Wang: This document is the starting point.

144
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:45.890
Simon Wang: And, and the, the Ofka… You see, if you go back to… the original search.

145
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.789
Simon Wang: If you go to the Ofka website.

146
00:13:53.390 --> 00:14:00.859
Simon Wang: Office of Communication Authority website, and you find… you look at information here about the emergency alert system, they will never tell you

147
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.600
Simon Wang: How many times the system was used, the old system was used.

148
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.719
Simon Wang: You see what I mean?

149
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.499
Simon Wang: So they're not lying.

150
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.159
Simon Wang: You can't say they're lying.

151
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.340
Simon Wang: But they're not disclosing all the information in a straightforward way.

152
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:26.429
Simon Wang: Alright? So that's why, being able to locate the information using this kind of tricks would be very, useful and important.

153
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.180
Simon Wang: It's the starting point of our research, basically.

154
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:44.019
Simon Wang: Okay, so… what you need to do today, Before we complete today's lesson, Is to try this trick.

155
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.230
Simon Wang: yourself.

156
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.830
Simon Wang: Okay?

157
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:54.829
Simon Wang: Once you agree on… The topic for your group to work on.

158
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.320
Simon Wang: then you need to try this Google site-specific search.

159
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:01.730
Simon Wang: Alright.

160
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:10.220
Simon Wang: And, we put a… Moodle here. Sorry, it takes me forever to… Log into Moodle.

161
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.660
Simon Wang: So, I would expect you to reply here.

162
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.600
Simon Wang: And, discuss how you use this little technique.

163
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.240
Simon Wang: To do your research for this project.

164
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.380
Simon Wang: Right?

165
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.550
Simon Wang: Hopefully you can do this today.

166
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:30.470
Simon Wang: This would become part of your reflective learning journals, right? Because later on, we need to write a reflective learning journal, so you can…

167
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.430
Simon Wang: Write about this as one of the points or issues you want to address.

168
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:45.300
Simon Wang: Okay, so, let's continue our… Attempt to form the groups.

169
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:51.080
Simon Wang: If you don't know… Where to find these Google Docs?

170
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:57.420
Simon Wang: You can go to our course website, Week 3.

171
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.589
Simon Wang: And, from here, there's the instructor notes.

172
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:05.570
Simon Wang: And here, you can open in Google Docs.

173
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.710
Simon Wang: And once you open the Google Docs.

174
00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:16.530
Simon Wang: You see there's, week 3, and under week 3, we have group formation.

175
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.019
Simon Wang: And, topic selection.

176
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.049
Simon Wang: And students taking the course.

177
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.870
Simon Wang: Alright, so…

178
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:43.820
Simon Wang: we have Group 5. Group 5 seems to be the most, you know, ready group.

179
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.800
Simon Wang: You got a topic, You got the members.

180
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.530
Simon Wang: Full view, right?

181
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.409
Simon Wang: And then… Group 6?

182
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.420
Simon Wang: Here.

183
00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.349
Simon Wang: So, have you decided your topic?

184
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.250
Simon Wang: Fire safety, okay. Seems like,

185
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:17.259
Simon Wang: let's put you down for fire safety for now. If there's another group wanting to do this, we can decide. Maybe each group would, you know.

186
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.560
Simon Wang: Just,

187
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.959
Simon Wang: Like, try a different focus or something.

188
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.809
Simon Wang: Okay, so now we have group 6, we have groups, 1.

189
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.189
Simon Wang: And we have group 5.

190
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.960
Simon Wang: Actually… In total.

191
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.200
Simon Wang: Right, so… it's Chong… wait, wait, so…

192
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.540
Simon Wang: Okay, you are actually group 6, so that means we don't have group… It's too.

193
00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:03.179
Simon Wang: Leo, hi… Oh, sorry, low height… low height home, okay.

207
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.349
Simon Wang: Who are you working with?

208
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.069
Simon Wang: Oh, okay.

209
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.130
Simon Wang: Alright.

210
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.919
Simon Wang: And, Liu…

211
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.020
Simon Wang: Liu Qingcheng?

212
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.270
Simon Wang: Not here.

213
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.029
Simon Wang: Yang Yun Shen not here.

214

Simon Wang: Dong Cheng Hao.

215
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.179
Simon Wang: Oh, here. How about Old Lord Him?

216
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.419
Simon Wang: Okay, so it seems like,

217
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.940
Simon Wang: Four, four students are not here.

218
00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.309
Simon Wang: But then we're… we're good, right? Other groups?

219
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.630
Simon Wang: So we have Group 1…

220
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:13.779
Simon Wang: Okay, so, Eric… Or is Eric?

221
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:20.279
Simon Wang: Okay, you, you can talk to, Hendrix a bit. That's Eric, that's Hendrix.

222
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.729
Simon Wang: How about, Hayden?

223
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.930
Simon Wang: Okay, so 3 of you. How about Alita?

224
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:27.949
Simon Wang: A little note here?

225
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.970
Simon Wang: Choi Ji-he?

226
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:35.960
Simon Wang: Okay, so four of you, you can talk a bit, and you can decide which topic you want to pursue.

227
00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:37.740
Simon Wang: Have you got something?

228
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.020
Simon Wang: Maybe you can talk a bit, alright?

229
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.160
Simon Wang: So, we have group 1, good…

230
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.870
Simon Wang: 2 groups 3, let's renumber it.

231
00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:00.540
Simon Wang: And we have group 4… And we have Group 5.

232
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:07.270
Simon Wang: Well, actually, I would hope… That's the number of groups we have.

233
00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:14.900
Simon Wang: So, for the students who are not yet in the group, you better join one of the groups, rather than start the new groups.

234
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.250
Simon Wang: But, hoi your fun.

235
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.420
Simon Wang: Can you add other… your group member's name here? Yeah.

236
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:35.650
Simon Wang: Great, so it looks like, we are in business. Okay, we just have to, you know, finalize everything.

237
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:43.019
Simon Wang: Yeah, let's take a few minutes and, settle things down.

238
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.309
Simon Wang: Well, we are still at the early stage of,

239
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:23.150
Simon Wang: forming the group, so I'd be happy to, like, give you a little bit more, like, information in terms of what we're going to do.

240
00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:38.580
Simon Wang: Now, if you come to… there's a subpage under week 3,

241
00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.199
Simon Wang: You can see, I've got some document here.

242
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.659
Simon Wang: And I will update this document in a minute.

243
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:53.839
Simon Wang: So now, I'd like to, maybe go through some of the topics here.

244
00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.360
Simon Wang: Oh, by the way.

245
00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.809
Simon Wang: Joyce… And, your name is?

246
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.820
Simon Wang: Kell it.

247
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.020
Simon Wang: Ken, right? Ken is… Kenneth.

248
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.579
Simon Wang: So, what would you like to do?

249
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.769
Simon Wang: Maybe just put… just put down a topic first.

250
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.500
Simon Wang: What's the topic you want to…

251
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:44.490
Simon Wang: Well, actually… I'm open to investigate the Education Bureau's policy.

252
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.669
Simon Wang: All special education needs students.

253
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.580
Simon Wang: If that's something you want to do.

254
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.940
Simon Wang: You see what I mean?

255
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.729
Simon Wang: But then, it's up to you.

256
00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:06.330
Simon Wang: Okay.

257
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:11.049
Simon Wang: So… So let me, let me just very quickly go through the…

258
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:21.939
Simon Wang: Go through the topics, Now, for fire services, There are different options.

259
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.740
Simon Wang: Because we have two groups who want to do file services, right?

260
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:35.960
Simon Wang: So my suggestion would be one group, You can consider The similar fire incidents.

261
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.939
Simon Wang: You know, it's very unfortunate that,

262
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:43.040
Simon Wang: We don't really learn lessons from history, right?

263
00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.009
Simon Wang: Remember that, who said that? Higo said that?

264
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:52.089
Simon Wang: It's something like, the only thing we learn from the histories is that we don't learn anything from history.

265
00:26:52.730 --> 00:27:01.039
Simon Wang: So, before the Hong Kong fire, the Taipo fire, there's actually some similar incidents, such as the one

266
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:09.849
Simon Wang: In London, 2017, and also… There's one, in Shanghai.

267
00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.819
Simon Wang: And, and other cities as well.

268
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.210
Simon Wang: So… The question is.

269
00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:30.610
Simon Wang: We would assume that the fire service department must have got a team that has been kind of following the news and curating all the information about the past fire incidents, right? There should be research being done on how to better understand

270
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:37.760
Simon Wang: the fire incidents, how… what lessons can be learned, how to prevent this incident from happening here in Hong Kong.

271
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:44.689
Simon Wang: So what we need to do is to approach the fire service department and ask them, do you have a team doing that?

272
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:52.920
Simon Wang: Okay? If you do have a team, then have you got any information on this past incident? What have you done with this information?

273
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.229
Simon Wang: Have you taken this into consideration when you…

274
00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:00.900
Simon Wang: manage the whole system in Hong Kong for fire prevention.

275
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:02.710
Simon Wang: Okay.

276
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:07.109
Simon Wang: So that would be the question that this team should pursue.

277
00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.790
Simon Wang: Alright.

278
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:20.500
Simon Wang: And I think that's a very important question, not just to going backwards and try to hold somebody accountable, it's also looking forward and see how the city can

279
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:26.530
Simon Wang: You know, learn from the past incidents from now on, so there won't be this kind of,

280
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.900
Simon Wang: Accidents and tragedy.

281
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.440
Simon Wang: Happening again.

282
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:38.359
Simon Wang: So… so… so that, that's, that's basically what this team should be, working on.

283
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.870
Simon Wang: Now, the second topic…

284
00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:52.180
Simon Wang: Or direction for the other team also working on this topic is… actually, you can look into an emergency alert system.

285
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.969
Simon Wang: So, if you see here, this is a very simple, it's a very short letter.

286
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.060
Simon Wang: Why not put the emergency alert system to use? It is sadly ironic.

287
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:17.450
Simon Wang: that an emergency alert system costing 115 million Hong Kong dollars to set up came into operation 5 years

288
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.330
Simon Wang: To the day before last week's fire tragedy, it has been used only once.

289
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:38.270
Simon Wang: And there were many complaints about its use. Are we reluctant to use it? What would have been the outcome last Wednesday if the alert system had been used? Perhaps we could consider this for future emergencies. There could be emergency messages sent out, firstly, for people.

290
00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:43.580
Simon Wang: To evacuate immediately, and secondly, for people to… and traffic to stay away from the area.

291
00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:47.819
Simon Wang: Now… This question was raised

292
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:54.269
Simon Wang: just a few weeks, you know, or a week after the tragedy. But in the coming months.

293
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.349
Simon Wang: You know, there's a panel working on this incident now.

294
00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:02.590
Simon Wang: And I'm sure that there will be more details coming out from that investigation.

295
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:11.029
Simon Wang: Okay? So once more information becomes available, we can then come back to this question again, and start asking the fire service department.

296
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.050
Simon Wang: What the hell are you doing?

297
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.260
Simon Wang: Right? In fact, before the tragedy.

298
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.340
Simon Wang: We approached the fire service department.

299
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.429
Simon Wang: and ask them how they plan to use emergency alert system. I can pull out that email.

300
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.210
Simon Wang: Okay?

301
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.250
Simon Wang: So that could be the… another direction.

302
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.789
Simon Wang: So, the two teams, you can, you can decide, alright?

303
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.629
Simon Wang: Nobody's working on eHouse.

304
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.860
Simon Wang: Anyone working in-house?

305
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:56.510
Simon Wang: Well, actually, there are quite a number of, letters on e-house.

306
00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:00.180
Simon Wang: So, if you want to work on e-house, you can look it up.

307
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:12.470
Simon Wang: And one specific, area, anyone who wants to work in eHouse could look at the reimbursement for an insurance company, you know.

308
00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:16.240
Simon Wang: Because when you got, a medical bill.

309
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:25.830
Simon Wang: Do you need to file for reimbursement? Right now, it's a very tedious process, right? You have to upload everything to a system, blah blah blah.

310
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:30.999
Simon Wang: But what if, you know, the minute you pay the hospital.

311
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:33.870
Simon Wang: The hospital will send the bill to the…

312
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:39.449
Simon Wang: insurance company, and then insurance company will deposit the money to me, you see what I mean?

313
00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.909
Simon Wang: So, I don't understand why, it's so complicated now.

314
00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:49.099
Simon Wang: So, if anyone who wants to do e-health, this could be the focus.

315
00:31:54.090 --> 00:32:01.629
Simon Wang: And, nobody want to do a Legislative Council data access? Alright, then I won't talk about it.

316
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.000
Simon Wang: And public hospital fee reduction.

317
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.880
Simon Wang: Okay.

318
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.940
Simon Wang: Anyway, so…

319
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:22.189
Simon Wang: Now, for those who want to, look at the government app review.

320
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:32.899
Simon Wang: You might want to look at some of the letters we published in the past, focusing on 1823.

321
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.730
Simon Wang: Do you know 1823?

322
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:46.059
Simon Wang: So 1823 is a hotline, so if you dial 1823, there's a government team taking your phone.

323
00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:49.560
Simon Wang: And, you, you tell the, the government

324
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:55.589
Simon Wang: staff, you know, what issue do you have, what questions do you have? Then they will try to answer your question.

325
00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.399
Simon Wang: But if they cannot answer your question, then they will direct your inquiry to a specific department.

326
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.610
Simon Wang: Okay.

327
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.970
Simon Wang: So, this is a way to boost efficiency.

328
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:10.710
Simon Wang: And then, in addition to the hotline, 1823, there's also an app.

329
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.500
Simon Wang: Okay.

330
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.060
Simon Wang: So, we,

331
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:24.840
Simon Wang: We did this, project before, this was published back in… 2021, 5 years ago.

332
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:34.250
Simon Wang: And, We review the app, so you might want to look at this letter To learn about…

333
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.730
Simon Wang: how,

334
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:43.189
Simon Wang: We can, you know, do something similar for the new app, you know, if it's for that,

335
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:47.460
Simon Wang: Job vacancy app, you know, it… it could be done.

336
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:54.715
Simon Wang: Alright…

337
00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:15.829
Simon Wang: So you see, actually, there are 3 letters published on the same app, so if you read all these letters, you will get a sense of what kind of critical review we can conduct on a particular app.

338
00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:21.989
Simon Wang: Okay, and we have one student who's working on rare disease. I will follow up with him.

339
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:26.540
Simon Wang: Right.

340
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.559
Simon Wang: So, any, any questions so far?

341
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:44.469
Simon Wang: So, I need to… I need your, gmail.

342
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.249
Simon Wang: Not, not number, just… Gmail. It has to be Gmail.

343
00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.929
Simon Wang: Because… Because we're using Google Docs.

344
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:18.989
Simon Wang: Okay, so, it seems like we are all settled, right? Anyone in this room?

345
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.499
Simon Wang: Does not have a group yet.

346
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:26.179
Simon Wang: And for those with the group, have you agreed on a topic?

347
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:32.220
Simon Wang: Yeah.

348
00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.010

Simon Wang: This is your Gmail?

351

Simon Wang: Do your Gmail start with a number?

352
00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.460
Simon Wang: This one.

353
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:06.789
Simon Wang: Can you… can you put your Gmail here? Or maybe ask your friends to help you.

354
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.930
Simon Wang: Who are you working with?

355
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.680

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.110
Simon Wang: Okay, anyway…

361
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:06.950
Simon Wang: So, that means… Let's see…

362
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.389
Simon Wang: Yeah, let's take a short break, I will update the Google Docs for you guys.

363
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:56.039
Simon Wang: Are you a good one? Yeah. Okay, so you haven't decided which, which topic to work on, right? Yeah, but… Okay.

364
00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.630
Simon Wang: Oh, okay, so you're interested in that call, okay.

365
00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:27.079

Simon Wang: Group 1 will be working on…

367
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:45.350
Simon Wang: legislative data access that we can talk more about.

368
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:53.259
Simon Wang: then, I… if I remember correctly, Group 2 will be working on file safety, right?

369
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.209

379
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:20.519
Simon Wang: Is this one?

380
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:32.240
Simon Wang: Oh, yeah, that's it.

381
00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:00.640
Simon Wang: Elvin, can you check your Gmail?

382
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.639
Simon Wang: Yes, I think, there could be a typo somewhere.

383
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.219
Simon Wang: Oh, okay, I, I saw it.

384
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:26.949
Simon Wang: No, there's something wrong.

385
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.450
Simon Wang: Yeah, L and X, you're more X, girl.

386

Simon Wang: X-O-O-R-M.

387
00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.460
Simon Wang: What happened?

388
00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.969
Simon Wang: You know what I'm wrong.

389
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:56.270
Simon Wang: Thanks.

390
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:11.819
Simon Wang: Okay, then you chat on your Gmail.

391
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.740
Simon Wang: B-R-C-C-Y-T3.

392
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.650
Simon Wang: Who's also you, Mom?

393
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:28.840
Simon Wang: At… huh?

394
00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.390
Simon Wang: The San Jose Bell.

395
00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:37.510
Simon Wang: Okay.

396
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:44.039
Simon Wang: So, I think we got… The groups, more or less.

397
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:47.330
Simon Wang: Settled. I mean, we still got a few,

398
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:52.210
Simon Wang: Students who haven't got a… got a group.

399
00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.110
Simon Wang: But… if you…

400
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:05.850
Simon Wang: So, are you… Are you new?

401
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:08.120
Simon Wang: Do you have a group?

402
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.090
Simon Wang: Okay.

403
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:17.290
Simon Wang: Okay, great. So, now, if you come to here, links to the Google Docs for each team,

404
00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:21.800
Simon Wang: Which is… Under here, tasks to complete.

405
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:28.590
Simon Wang: So, each group has got one Google Docs.

406
00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:32.939
Simon Wang: Alright, like, good, good one is right here.

407
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.140
Simon Wang: Okay.

408
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:46.580
Simon Wang: So, what you need to do is to create a, copy…

409
00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:55.269
Simon Wang: of this table, so each team member will be, working on one table.

410
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.930
Simon Wang: Alright.

411
00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:04.329
Simon Wang: So… If you copy this… This will become a template.

412
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:08.040
Simon Wang: For you to, collect the information.

413
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:15.760
Simon Wang: Now, this is the first step, okay? Remember the emergence alert system?

414
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:20.050
Simon Wang: we go to the Legislative Council website, we find some document about

415
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:27.269
Simon Wang: emergency loss system, we learned that, actually, there was an old system, and that system was used only

416
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:34.949
Simon Wang: Like, there's, like, 12 times being used in one year, but then in the past 10 years, you know, very few times.

417
00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:47.740
Simon Wang: So that's actually a piece of document which is very important for our next step, which is to critically review the program and start asking questions for the government staff to answer.

418
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:54.449
Simon Wang: So, what we need to do today is, for each team member, To complete the table.

419
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.620
Simon Wang: It can start with just one table.

420
00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:07.700
Simon Wang: And in that table, you need to find a document online. It could be a web page, it could be a newspaper article, it could be a government document.

421
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.809
Simon Wang: So everybody should be working on just one table.

422
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:18.029
Simon Wang: And to find that document, and you want to follow this format, which begins with the title of the document.

423
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.349
Simon Wang: The contributor would be you, so you put your name here, you contribute this article.

424
00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:31.470
Simon Wang: the URL… Some facts that you identify in that article, some comments or questions you may have.

425
00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:40.229
Simon Wang: Another piece of facts… some comments. If you want to add more, you can, you know, Insert rows below.

426
00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:46.789
Simon Wang: And here you can put the full text, or if it's too long, then you can put some excerpts.

427
00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:51.690
Simon Wang: So, full text, or… excerpts.

428
00:54:55.310 --> 00:55:01.110
Simon Wang: Alright, and of course, you're still exploring, so…

429
00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:12.230
Simon Wang: So, you know, this is something we have to kind of negotiate in the next 30 minutes or so. You can talk to your group members, and you can talk to me.

430
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.909
Simon Wang: But, I want to make sure that everybody know where to…

431
00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:21.089
Simon Wang: do this work, so every team should go to Google Docs.

432
00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:28.749
Simon Wang: But then for the two teams working on fire services, we have to make a decision now.

433
00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.090
Simon Wang: So, which team will be working on which direction?

434
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:36.359
Simon Wang: So, Group 2, raise your hand.

435
00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:40.859
Simon Wang: Okay, and group full, raise your hand.

436
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.010
Simon Wang: Okay, so there are two options.

437
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:47.789
Simon Wang: Option 1 is to look into, learning from the past.

438
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:54.989
Simon Wang: Okay, and option two is to looking at the emergency alert system, or how to alert the people.

439
00:55:55.130 --> 00:56:05.750
Simon Wang: So there's two options, and then there's option number three, which is you… it's more open-ended. You can explore more, and you can decide later what is the focus. So you need to tell me now.

440
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.989
Simon Wang: Which option do you take?

441
00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:22.430
Simon Wang: Learning from the past, and you are a group… 2. Okay.

442
00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.010
Simon Wang: So that's first comes, first served.

443
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:47.479
Simon Wang: So, for the second team, do you want to look at emergency alert system, or do you want to try something else?

444
00:56:53.050 --> 00:57:03.000
Simon Wang: So there are two options, right? But one option is already been taken by group one, which is look at the lessons from the past, how the fire service department learned from the past.

445
00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:11.510
Simon Wang: And the second option is to look at emergency alert system or any other system for notified people during the fire.

446
00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:18.950
Simon Wang: But then there's a third option, is you don't want to decide now, you can explore a bit more and decide later.

447
00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:22.830
Simon Wang: Okay, good.

448
00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:33.919
Simon Wang: So that means, you are open-ended.

449
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:36.030
Simon Wang: Great.

450
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:41.580
Simon Wang: So, for the other group.

451
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:52.559
Simon Wang: For the other group, I know Group 1 is working on Legislative Council data access, so maybe I should come back.

452
00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.650
Simon Wang: And talk a little bit more about this.

453
00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:06.420
Simon Wang: Now, for Legislative Council data access, One of the premises

454
00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:14.370
Simon Wang: for this project is that the Legislative Council should be transparent And open to the public.

455
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:24.960
Simon Wang: So the members of the public should find it very easy and straightforward to locate information about the businesses at the Legislative Council.

456
00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:30.709
Simon Wang: And to be more specific, we want to consider and explore how data is being

457
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:35.919
Simon Wang: Curated and being stored and made available to the public.

458
00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:37.480
Simon Wang: Okay?

459
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:42.150
Simon Wang: That means there are different data sources we want to consider.

460
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:52.340
Simon Wang: Which would include… This particular website.

461
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:58.479
Simon Wang: So here you can see there's the Legislative Council databases, or you can actually search for it.

462
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:10.110
Simon Wang: So there's the members database, there's Members Interest Database, Bills Database, Database on Official Records of Proceedings, Rules Database, Research Publication Database.

463
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:15.750
Simon Wang: And also, Legislative Council Briefs database.

464
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:22.590
Simon Wang: So, a total of 7 databases, Would be, available.

465
00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:30.849
Simon Wang: But then there's the… Eighth one, which, unfortunately, it didn't put it here.

466
00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:34.679
Simon Wang: So, if you go to the…

467
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.939
Simon Wang: Open Data Portal.

468
00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:47.660
Simon Wang: Well, actually, not here.

469
00:59:53.980 --> 01:00:03.370
Simon Wang: So, if you go to this website, you can see that there's actually… One of the data providers

470
01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:05.700
Simon Wang: is Legislative Council.

471
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:14.050
Simon Wang: Okay, so this link would give you a list of database, or data, you know, data sets.

472
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.160
Simon Wang: That are available through the… data portal of the Hong Kong government.

473
01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:23.950
Simon Wang: Okay?

474
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:31.430
Simon Wang: So now, we've… we identified at least 7… databases.

475
01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.719
Simon Wang: So there's this database, HTML, the page.

476
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:49.310
Simon Wang: And then, yeah, okay, I should put it here already.

477
01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:59.400
Simon Wang: So the question would become, Can these different data sources still be… Consolidated.

478
01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:08.630
Simon Wang: And how can the Legislative Council make it easier for the general public to access the information?

479
01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.700
Simon Wang: Alright.

480
01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:23.380
Simon Wang: Because if you look at these pages here, you know, there's all these different databases, But then…

481
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:31.900
Simon Wang: From the perspective of an ordinary member of the public, Do we find this… Databases useful.

482
01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:34.660
Simon Wang: Or convenient to access.

483
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:44.890
Simon Wang: You see, there's an interface to search And there's a different, Government bureaus.

484
01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:51.800
Simon Wang: Apparently, you can search, right? You can search for this Legislative Council briefs.

485
01:01:53.390 --> 01:02:02.420
Simon Wang: But then immediately we can, contact the legislative council and say, this particular page, how many people have been using it in the past 12 months?

486
01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:04.200
Simon Wang: Is that me?

487
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:11.950
Simon Wang: And that's the kind of data we can get from the Legislative Council, and then start evaluating whether this page is designed well enough.

488
01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.800
Simon Wang: to attract people.

489
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:17.779
Simon Wang: But then, in addition to the UI,

490
01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.380
Simon Wang: We need to ask for the raw data.

491
01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:32.640
Simon Wang: Right? So the data should be available not just to UI, graphical user interface, it should be also made available through API, you know, for programming access.

492
01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:37.909
Simon Wang: So that, that will be another, issue to explore.

493
01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:39.150
Simon Wang: Okay.

494
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:51.440
Simon Wang: So the general goal of this project is to investigate to what extent the Legislative Council has made data publicly available, that is convenient for the public.

495
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:55.950
Simon Wang: And also, in what ways can this data access scheme to be improved?

496
01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:03.100
Simon Wang: Which also includes… Programmatic access.

497
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:07.359
Simon Wang: Because if this information is become…

498
01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:16.029
Simon Wang: Accessible through computer programming, then we can also explore how to, build new applications

499
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.239
Simon Wang: Based on this data, for example, a chatbot.

500
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:25.740
Simon Wang: Okay, a chapel that can answer questions about legislative council businesses. That might be something.

501
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:27.539
Simon Wang: We want to explore as well.

502
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:32.699
Simon Wang: I hope that makes sense, so that would be something you can work on.

503
01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.320
Simon Wang: for this… Coors.

504
01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.370
Simon Wang: Right.

505
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:54.730
Simon Wang: So… we got, I think there's a third hour I want to cover something else, but for…

506
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:57.719
Simon Wang: The next, you know, half an hour or so.

507
01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:04.840
Simon Wang: I'd like each team to start exploring and looking for publicly available information.

508
01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:10.779
Simon Wang: And, update the document assigned to you.

509
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:23.959
Simon Wang: Okay? So, and of course, you guys can… Have a short meeting.

510
01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:35.020
Simon Wang: And, remember we talk about Site-specific search, so… Presumably, you want to… Try the site-specific search.

511
01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:42.779
Simon Wang: So there's a second task you also want to complete today, or at least get started.

512
01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:46.230
Simon Wang: is to… you know, curate.

513
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:48.990
Simon Wang: The publicly available information.

514
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:51.560
Simon Wang: Again, it's a Moodle.

515
01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:59.219
Simon Wang: But, before you reply anything to Moodle, you want to first update the Google Docs.

516
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.090
Simon Wang: And then you can add a link.

517
01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:05.460
Simon Wang: in your Moodle reply to tell people what you have done.

518
01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.920
Simon Wang: For creating the information.

519
01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:23.419
Simon Wang: Because once we have more information curated or collected, then we can start reviewing them, and then we can start asking questions for the government staff to answer. So that will be something we can discuss next week. But for this week.

520
01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:27.579
Simon Wang: Our main focus is to… to find more information.

521
01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.079
Simon Wang: Now, one last thing I would,

522
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:36.330
Simon Wang: remind you before I let you work on this.

523
01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:43.210
Simon Wang: Is that when you're looking for information that is publicly available on a topic.

524
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:46.859
Simon Wang: You want to have some kind of hypothesis.

525
01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:48.820
Simon Wang: Okay?

526
01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:56.329
Simon Wang: And, that means you want to start thinking, you know.

527
01:05:56.690 --> 01:06:01.980
Simon Wang: What could be something that the government can do to improve this program.

528
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:06.970
Simon Wang: Of course, at this stage, it's very hard to…

529
01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:17.039
Simon Wang: make any conclusion, right? Because we haven't done the research. But you need to have some kind of gut feeling, you need to have some kind of intuition about,

530
01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.619
Simon Wang: You know, what is the area where the government can do a better job?

531
01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:23.990
Simon Wang: So, you need to have that sense

532
01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:28.500
Simon Wang: So, kind of… some kind of hypothesis that you can test.

533
01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:30.209
Simon Wang: With the real data.

534
01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:37.350
Simon Wang: But the hypothesis will guide you to look for the documents. If you have no idea, you know, exactly what

535
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:43.590
Simon Wang: you're looking for, I mean, Of course, not exactly, but… but some sense of what you're looking for.

536
01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.049
Simon Wang: Then you may not be able to find what you need, okay?

537
01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.169
Simon Wang: So, that's why, to have this…

538
01:06:52.190 --> 01:07:04.240
Simon Wang: you know, hypothesis, this, in terms of what the government can do a better job. That's very important. But I think for most teams, you already got

539
01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:06.250
Simon Wang: This sense, right?

540
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.050
Simon Wang: Good morning, good cue!

541
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.369
Simon Wang: So you guys want to do Scammitar?

542
01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:36.909
Simon Wang: Actually, last semester, the two team students already did that.

543
01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:44.979
Simon Wang: So, and we kind of hit a dead end there, because the police is not very collaborative.

544
01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:46.430
Simon Wang: offering data.

545
01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:54.950
Simon Wang: So, I would suggest you try something else. In fact, I think the government recruitment app, the Civil Service Bureau app, could be very good.

546
01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.829
Simon Wang: So I would suggest you stick to that.

547
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.950
Simon Wang: Cause, yeah.

548
01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:07.450
Simon Wang: That's very unfortunate, but, we, we actually published a letter on that.

549
01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.220
Simon Wang: I think we did.

550
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:24.470
Simon Wang: Okay, so this, this is the news, but then we, we, we, we had a…

551
01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:32.990
Simon Wang: Anyway…

552
01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:54.460
Simon Wang: Okay, so yeah, so maybe you can start working on, the… the… the tasks?

553
01:08:54.649 --> 01:08:59.080
Simon Wang: And let me know if you got any… Questions?
