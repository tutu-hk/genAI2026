# Week 3 Lecture Summary & Actionable Insights for Students

*Based on the three Week 3 lecture transcripts (in-class session, Moodle task briefing, and AI Agent session).*

## 1. Summary of the Three Sessions

### Session 1 (1.vtt) — Course goals, research method, group work

- **Course goal (memorise this):** *Critically review* a government **program** and make recommendations on how it can serve the public better.
  - **“Critically review”** = assume the program has room for improvement (don’t just describe it).
  - **Program** = concrete, with specific goals and funding; **policy** = broad direction (e.g. “education hub”) — the project focuses on programs, not policies.
- **“Follow the money”:** Look at budget, number of beneficiaries, and cost per capita; this often reveals problems (e.g. low uptake).
- **First step of the project:** Find what is **publicly available** (e.g. via search and site-specific search).
- **Google site-specific search (core skill):**
  - Syntax: `"your exact phrase" site:domain` (e.g. `"emergency alert system" site:legco.gov.hk`).
  - Use the **domain only** (no `https://`).
  - Example: LegCo document on emergency alert system usage (e.g. “used 12 times in 12 months”) was found this way; the same figure was not clearly stated on the OFCA site — so official sites don’t always disclose everything in one place.
- **Group formation & topics:** Fire services (e.g. “lessons from past incidents” vs “emergency alert system”), eHouse, 1823, LegCo data access, government app review, rare disease, etc. Each group has one Google Doc; each member fills at least one **information table** (title, contributor, URL, facts, comments, full text/excerpts).
- **Hypothesis:** When searching, have a rough idea of “what could the government do better?” — it guides which documents and facts to look for.
- **LegCo data access (Group 1):** Multiple LegCo databases + Open Data Portal; questions include how they connect, usability for the public, and API/programmatic access (e.g. for a LegCo Q&A chatbot).

### Session 2 (2.vtt) — Moodle tasks and reflection

- **Two Week 3 tasks:** (1) **Learn and reflect** (Moodle Task 3.1), (2) **Curate publicly available information** (Moodle Task 3.2).
- **What “learning” means here:** Long-term **change in behaviour**, not only new facts. For site-specific search: after this week, you should actually use `site:domain` when you need information from a specific site — and describe that in your reflection.
- **Task 3.1 (Learn and reflect):**
  - **Minimum:** Find the LegCo document that states how often the (old) emergency alert system was used — use site-specific search as in class, then provide the link and briefly describe how you did it.
  - **Better:** Apply the same technique to **your group’s topic** (e.g. `"government vacancies" site:gov.hk` or `site:scmp.com`), compare with/without `site:`, and write a short narrative/case study on how it helped.
  - Moodle replies will be used later as first drafts for **reflective learning journals** — so write clearly and concretely.
- **Task 3.2 (Curate information):**
  - In your group’s Google Doc, add tables (use **Heading 3** for sections so you can paste links to specific sections in Moodle).
  - For each source: document what you found and, importantly, **what insights or critical questions** it raises (leading to questions for the government later).
  - In Moodle, post the link to your section and a short reflection on the **process of critical review** (not just “I found a document”).

### Session 3 (3.vtt) — AI Agent and IDE (optional but recommended)

- **AI Agent vs chatbot:** An agent uses an LLM plus **tools** to take actions (e.g. read links, create files/folders); a chatbot mainly returns text.
- **IDE (e.g. VS Code, Cursor)** with an AI agent is not only for coding — it can be used for **text and document tasks** (e.g. summarising, structuring, drafting).
- **Demo:** Instructor put instructions in a file (e.g. “fetch info from this link, create one folder per project”); the agent read the file, visited links and Google Docs, and created structured folders — illustrating that a lot of information-gathering and structuring can be done quickly with clear instructions.
- **Takeaway:** Learning to use an AI agent in an IDE can make you much more efficient (e.g. “30% of the project in 10 minutes”); the instructor’s view is that this is becoming essential for employability. Optional steps: GitHub account (HKBU email), GitHub Education benefit, fork the course repo, try VS Code or GitHub Codespaces; ~30 minutes of learning can save many hours later.
- **Critical use:** Always **read and check** the agent’s output for errors and hallucinations; don’t submit it unread.

## 2. Actionable Insights for Students Taking the Course

### A. Clarify the project focus

- **Action:** Write down in one sentence: “We are **critically reviewing** a government **program** (not policy) and will recommend how it can do better.”
- **Action:** Identify your program’s **goals, funding, and beneficiaries**; if possible, get rough figures (budget, cost per capita, uptake) — “follow the money.”

### B. Master site-specific search (required)

- **Action:** Practise: `"your topic keywords" site:legco.gov.hk` and `site:gov.hk` (and other relevant domains). Use quotation marks for exact phrases.
- **Action:** Complete Moodle Task 3.1 by (1) finding the LegCo emergency-alert document as in class, and (2) doing at least one search for **your group’s topic** and describing what you found and how.
- **Action:** Use this technique whenever you look for official or focused sources; mention this behavioural change in your reflective learning journal.

### C. Start with a hypothesis

- **Action:** As a group, draft 1–2 sentences: “We suspect the government could do better by…” or “We want to test whether…” Use this to decide what documents and facts to search for.

### D. Curate sources in the group Google Doc (required)

- **Action:** Each member: add at least one table (title, contributor, URL, facts, comments, excerpt). Use **Heading 3** for each source/section so you can link from Moodle.
- **Action:** For each source, add **insights or critical questions** (e.g. “This says X but doesn’t mention Y”; “Cost per user seems high”) — this leads to questions for the government later.
- **Action:** Post the link to your section in Moodle Task 3.2 and write a short reflection on the **critical review process**, not just “I found a document.”

### E. Write for your reflective learning journal now

- **Action:** Treat every Moodle reply as a first draft for your reflective learning journal: write in full sentences, give examples (e.g. which search you did, what you found), and explain how your **behaviour** (e.g. search habits) or thinking has changed.

### F. Optional: Try an AI agent in an IDE

- **Action:** If you have 30–60 minutes, try: GitHub account (HKBU email) → GitHub Education benefit → fork course repo → open in VS Code or Codespaces → give the agent a file with clear instructions (e.g. “visit these links and summarise structure”).
- **Action:** Always **read and verify** the agent’s output before using it in your project or submission.

### G. Prepare for next week

- **Action:** Next week focuses on **requesting information from the government** (e.g. Code on Access to Information). Keep a list of questions that your curated documents don’t answer — those are candidates for official requests.

## 3. Quick reference: Site-specific search

| What you want              | Example query                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| LegCo only                | `"emergency alert system" site:legco.gov.hk`       |
| Hong Kong government only | `"your topic" site:gov.hk`                         |
| One news outlet           | `"your topic" site:scmp.com`                       |
| Exact phrase              | Use double quotation marks around the phrase       |

**Rule:** `site:` + **domain only** (no `https://` or path).
