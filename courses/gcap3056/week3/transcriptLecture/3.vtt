00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.930
Simon Wang: So, what I will discuss in the next, I don't know, 20 minutes or so.

2
00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.740
Simon Wang: would be a, a new technology about AI,

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:27.090
Simon Wang: that, I don't really necessarily would expect everybody to use it. Of course, I hope everybody will use it, but, if you feel like it's too complicated or whatever.

4
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.569
Simon Wang: you can… you can give it a try, but then it's not, like, mandatory or anything. But I just want to kind of,

5
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.289
Simon Wang: Give this… introduction to you, because I believe this is very, promising, with a lot of potential.

6
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.119
Simon Wang: So I hope you can pay a little bit more attention here, okay?

7
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.179
Simon Wang: So… If you go to the… let me see…

8
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.950
Simon Wang: We have a table of content here, right, for Google Docs?

9
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.179
Simon Wang: And if you go to the last session, AI Agent EID,

10
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.490
Simon Wang: So that's, that's what I'm, I'm, I'm trying to talk about here.

11
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.840
Simon Wang: First of all, I'm sure that you all use AI, right? Raise your hand if you use AI.

12
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.100
Simon Wang: Okay.

13
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.859
Simon Wang: But, I would assume that you all use AI through chatbot, right? You talk to your chatbot.

14
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.649
Simon Wang: Anyone use AI in IDE, or what do we call Integrated Development Environment?

15
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.679
Simon Wang: cursor, right, or VS Code, okay, a few, right? Good. So, then for those of you who…

16
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.040
Simon Wang: know what is IDE?

17
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.050
Simon Wang: And having been using Cursor, that's great, so maybe you can help the other students a bit, okay?

18
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.699
Simon Wang: And that's what I'm trying to talk about today. What is AI Agent? Okay, so AI Agent, this is an article from Nature.

19
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.190
Simon Wang: It says, rather than follow prescribed

20
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:09.599
Simon Wang: instruction for each task agents use LLMs, large language models, to make and refine plans on the fly for a variety of multi-step goals.

21
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.150
Simon Wang: Unlike long LLM, they also harness tools to take actions in the real world.

22
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.440
Simon Wang: Okay?

23
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:31.550
Simon Wang: So, essentially, there are two ways to communicate with AI. I think most people would use the browser, right? Go to poll.com, go to GenAI at HKBU, go to ChatGPT, and talk to

24
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.349
Simon Wang: and AI, you know, as a chatbot.

25
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.659
Simon Wang: But then, today, I want to introduce Integrated Development Environment.

26
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.990
Simon Wang: Which is kind of a more advanced way of using AI.

27
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.419
Simon Wang: And, there's… there will be a learning curve, but I hope you can give it a try.

28
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.879
Simon Wang: You know, maybe, maybe you will like it, you see what I mean?

29
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.839
Simon Wang: Okay, so what is IDE?

30
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.130
Simon Wang: Well, IDE stands for, Integrated Development Environment.

31
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.820
Simon Wang: Okay? So, it offers an environment for programmers to write, run, and test codes.

32
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.330
Simon Wang: Common IDEs includes VS Code and Cursor. There's a couple of others.

33
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.660
Simon Wang: An AI agent is embedded in the IDE to help human developers to take actions on files and folders.

34
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.030
Simon Wang: But…

35
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:37.170
Simon Wang: If IDE is only for programming, then that's not really relevant to the rest of us, right? If you're not doing programming, why you should learn IDE?

36
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.540
Simon Wang: Well, my argument would be IDE with AI Agent is not just for programming. It can be used for more general tasks.

37
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.359
Simon Wang: Any text processing tasks can be done.

38
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.379
Simon Wang: with IDE and AI agent.

39
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.110
Simon Wang: Okay?

40
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.290
Simon Wang: So… That's, that's my, that's my argument, that's my message here.

41
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.740
Simon Wang: Its use is not limited to programming.

42
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.140
Simon Wang: We can also use it to process multi-modal documents.

43
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.770
Simon Wang: Which, which I believe is, is, is super, super exciting.

44
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.450
Simon Wang: If you want to know exactly what is IDE, it looks like something like this.

45
00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.260
Simon Wang: So on the left-hand side, you see some folders and files.

46
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.460
Simon Wang: And then in the middle panel, you can actually edit the files, and then on the right-hand side, there will be an AI agent.

47
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.049
Simon Wang: Okay? So… Are you, are you with me?

48
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.619
Simon Wang: But if IDE is new to you, maybe you're not.

49
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.120
Simon Wang: But, I should give you a little bit of, a demo.

50
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.429
Simon Wang: So, for those of you who already know, maybe you can later on walk around and help the other students.

51
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.050
Simon Wang: Great!

52
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.149
Simon Wang: So what do we do here?

53
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.860
Simon Wang: Let me first, Do a demo, okay? Let's do a demo.

54
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.420
Simon Wang: How do you do a demo? Well…

55
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.240
Simon Wang: Because, at some point, you will try it yourself, So…

56
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.350
Simon Wang: what I would suggest you to do is No.

57
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.670
Simon Wang: Or you can do it later.

58
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.229
Simon Wang: is to get a GitHub.

59
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.430
Simon Wang: account.

60
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.869
Simon Wang: So that's,

61
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.360
Simon Wang: Yo, that sounds a bit, unusual, right?

62
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.310
Simon Wang: Because, why a language teacher

63
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.129
Simon Wang: asked me to set up a GitHub account.

64
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.189
Simon Wang: But I think that's… that's what makes the whole thing so exciting.

65
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:05.909
Simon Wang: So go… go get a GitHub account using your HKBU email. That shouldn't take you much time, just 2 minutes.

66
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.590
Simon Wang: Go ahead.

67
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.020
Simon Wang: And then, you can apply for, education benefit.

68
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.020
Simon Wang: Okay?

69
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.720
Simon Wang: Apply… GitHub Education, as a student…

70
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:33.969
Simon Wang: Now, no pressure, okay? So if you at some point feel that it's too much for you, that's okay, no worry. You can definitely do well in this course without

71
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:41.530
Simon Wang: Doing any of this, but… you never know. Maybe you will find this very useful.

72
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:51.560
Simon Wang: Now, once you… well, it would take a little bit of time, obviously, to get to that point.

73
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:59.440
Simon Wang: And then the next step is to go to… my… repository.

74
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.620
Simon Wang: which is General AI…

75
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.459
Simon Wang: Which is generally AI 2026.

76
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.049
Simon Wang: Now, today, I will mainly just do some demo.

77
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.809
Simon Wang: I will do the demo, so hopefully you will see the power of AI Agent.

78
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:37.769
Simon Wang: And you will be impressed enough, you will go home and find some time and figure out how to do it yourself, how to be on board, okay? So my job, I'm a salesperson. I'm giving you a pitch and trying to convince you that this is very useful.

79
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.429
Simon Wang: But I don't know if I will be successful.

80
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.840
Simon Wang: But I will give it a try.

81
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.300
Simon Wang: Now, at some point, you can come to this link.

82
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:56.580
Simon Wang: And, you can fork it, okay? So you can… well, if for those of you who already know how to do this, you can fork it, okay?

83
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.340
Simon Wang: But… but that's later, you can fork later. Now I'm going to do a demo.

84
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.949
Simon Wang: You see, in this document here, There's a README,

85
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:26.239
Simon Wang: Not much here. I can add more info. So I'm trying to, set up a launch and AI ambassador program in this university, okay? And I have some money, I can do that.

86
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:37.000
Simon Wang: And… and we have a kind of a plan, Right? So…

87
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:45.799
Simon Wang: So, we're gonna recruit some students to join this program, and you are welcome to join.

88
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.650
Simon Wang: So today, you received the basic training.

89
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.420
Simon Wang: And then you can train other people, Okay?

90
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.320
Simon Wang: It's like going viral, right?

91
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.840
Simon Wang: Right?

92
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:07.539
Simon Wang: So there are three levels. Level 1 is we use AI to process documents, which I will demonstrate today.

93
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.499
Simon Wang: And Level 2 is API integration, and Level 3 is to, leverage some GitHub projects.

94
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:28.219
Simon Wang: So… If you want to, learned the IDE thing.

95
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.160
Simon Wang: You can either… download.

96
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:43.679
Simon Wang: You can either download the VS Code, or you can get a VS Code online. To get a VS Code online, you can just, click on this code space.

97
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.670
Simon Wang: Okay?

98
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.590
Simon Wang: Now, I'm not asking you to follow my steps, I'm just doing demo here.

99
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:55.169
Simon Wang: But I hope the demo is impressive enough

100
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.919
Simon Wang: For you to want to pick it up.

101
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.950
Simon Wang: then I can give you more instruction and info to try it.

102
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.830
Simon Wang: So this is IDE.

103
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.240
Simon Wang: Okay, so this is IDE.

104
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.950
Simon Wang: or integrated… development environment.

105
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.990
Simon Wang: And here, we got a couple of…

106
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:28.260
Simon Wang: We got a couple of, files, Okay.

107
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.150
Simon Wang: We have Plan, we have README, and everything.

108
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.830
Simon Wang: No.

109
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.589
Simon Wang: What do we do here?

110
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.510
Simon Wang: Let's say I set up… a page.

111
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.529
Simon Wang: I set up a folder, which is GCAP.

112
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.360
Simon Wang: 3056.

113
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.100
Simon Wang: Okay?

114
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:50.390
Simon Wang: So… and under this folder, I will get… another… I put up a file, You know, it can be…

115
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.160
Simon Wang: any name, let's say, start.

116
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.090
Simon Wang: Okay.

117
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:04.160
Simon Wang: So, we have start, And here, it's empty right now.

118
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.560
Simon Wang: So I can write a few words.

119
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.889
Simon Wang: So I say I'm teaching this course, you can fetch some info here.

120
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:33.350
Simon Wang: And I will put… the, info here.

121
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.440
Simon Wang: And then they say,

122
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.440
Simon Wang: We have this… document.

123
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.190
Simon Wang: And in this document, we have 6 groups.

124
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.770
Simon Wang: Okay.

125
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.509
Simon Wang: So I just say.

126
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:16.179
Simon Wang: You can find… 6 groups.

127
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.590
Simon Wang: with Google, Docs, links.

128
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.660
Simon Wang: Fetch, info, and create.

129
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.090
Simon Wang: one folder.

130
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.290
Simon Wang: Cool.

131
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.440
Simon Wang: Under.

132
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:54.009
Simon Wang: Alright, so I hope that makes sense to you. You see, I'm also talking to AI, but I'm not using a chatbot. Instead, I added a file. The file name is star.md, which is Markdown.

133
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:59.710
Simon Wang: And they say, I'm teaching a course, and you can find some info about this course through this link.

134
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:05.190
Simon Wang: I mean, maybe I should… I should, remove this 3 or whatever?

135
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:07.950
Simon Wang: Okay?

136
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.010
Simon Wang: So they would go to that link.

137
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.649
Simon Wang: And then they say, oh, we have this Google Spreadsheet.

138
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.979
Simon Wang: And you go to the Google spreadsheet, you will find some Google Docs link.

139
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.739
Simon Wang: And based on the Google Docs, create

140
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.770
Simon Wang: A folder for each project.

141
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:54.079
Simon Wang: So, essentially, I asked… I got all these instructions.

142
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.479
Simon Wang: Okay? But it's in a file.

143
00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:05.480
Simon Wang: So, for those of you who use Cursor or IDE, how do I send this file over to the agent?

144
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.769
Simon Wang: The chat is here, right?

145
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:24.360
Simon Wang: So, this is agent, alright? This is agent. So, remember, there's different options here. Make sure it's agent, and then, well, let's test and say hi to agent first. Hello!

146
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:42.699
Simon Wang: So, well, in order to send this file over, there are two ways. One is just copy and paste, right? You can copy and paste everything and put it here.

147
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:49.390
Simon Wang: But usually what I do is I will right-click and then copy-pass, right?

148
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:55.179
Simon Wang: So I copy-pass… And, well, it takes a little while.

149
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:03.929
Simon Wang: But you see, if you put this to a chapel, let's say you go to Ho or whatever.

150
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:22.059
Simon Wang: You know, you can go to a poll, or even… let's try publicity, because publicity can go online, right?

151
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.950
Simon Wang: Oops.

152
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:35.369
Simon Wang: I copy this over, and I give it to Poe. Let's see what Poe has to say.

153
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.000
Simon Wang: Oops, not working.

154
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.130
Simon Wang: Try again.

155
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.600
Simon Wang: So you see, Ho is also able to do something for us.

156
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:09.229
Simon Wang: But… You still have to, like… Copy and paste, right?

157
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.159
Simon Wang: You know, Paul can do a little bit.

158
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.980
Simon Wang: But it's in their environment, it's not in our environment, that's the difference.

159
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:27.839
Simon Wang: Okay? So what we're going to do now is… I will send this pass to agent.

160
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:38.949
Simon Wang: Now, when I send this path to agent, what will happen is… They will read…

161
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.670
Simon Wang: The content through this path.

162
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.390
Simon Wang: And then they will fetch information from the link.

163
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.080
Simon Wang: Okay?

164
00:17:50.180 --> 00:18:00.859
Simon Wang: But they found, actually, the website is not very accessible. But then they will start… go to the Google Sheet to get information, and from the Google Sheet, they will find

165
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.900
Simon Wang: the Google Docs. There's a total of 6 Google Docs.

166
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.279
Simon Wang: And they will go to the Google Docs.

167
00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:18.009
Simon Wang: And once they go to the Google Docs, they will know what each project is about.

168
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.929
Simon Wang: Now they've found the 6 Google Docs links.

169
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.450
Simon Wang: And this is agent, okay? Agent is different from chatbot.

170
00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.700
Simon Wang: Chatbot can only reply to you with text.

171
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.280
Simon Wang: But agent can actually start doing things on your folder.

172
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:53.780
Simon Wang: I've gathered all the key information, got more contents, and then they start reading our Google Docs.

173
00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:03.739
Simon Wang: So, Group 1, Netcode data access, Group 2, Fire Service, Group 3, Government App.

174
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.250
Simon Wang: Google Full File Service 2…

175
00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:11.979
Simon Wang: and Google 5, Group 5, and then Group 6. I think there's, 6 groups, right?

176
00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.950
Simon Wang: How come there's only 5 groups?

177
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.450
Simon Wang: Should be 6 groups.

178
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.709
Simon Wang: And then they will create the folders for me.

179
00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.769
Simon Wang: So how come the A agent can do that?

180
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.819
Simon Wang: you know, it's… in a way, it's the same, right? It's…

181
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.470
Simon Wang: It's just GPT, it's… it's Launch Language Model.

182
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:01.960
Simon Wang: But…

183
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.690
Simon Wang: The agent has access to tools

184
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:16.459
Simon Wang: Okay? And these tools will be able to do things for us.

185
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.319
Simon Wang: I don't know why… what happened to Group 6, because there should be 6 groups.

186
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.380
Simon Wang: But you see, the agents keep working.

187
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.160
Simon Wang: He's doing all the stuff.

188
00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:51.780
Simon Wang: Now, you can see, based on the Google Docs info, Now, they create a… document here.

189
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.750
Simon Wang: Okay?

190
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:14.219
Simon Wang: Now… I hope you can see that AI Agent can actually search the internet, and Access the online document.

191
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.350
Simon Wang: Which is pretty amazing.

192
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.370
Simon Wang: Right So, what do I do next?

193
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.570
Simon Wang: Let's do a quick demo.

194
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.999
Simon Wang: Let's… let's work on legislative console data access just a little bit.

195
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:52.370
Simon Wang: So, I created a new document called Data Explorer, As, I mentioned earlier, We have a couple of…

196
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.469
Simon Wang: different… Data sources.

197
00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.570
Simon Wang: Like, Stace 3, right?

198
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:12.290
Simon Wang: So, I'm going to put… All the information here.

199
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:21.829
Simon Wang: So I said, okay, this is my question. How different info sources on legislative council discernment matters are connected?

200
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.470
Simon Wang: So, we have 3 links.

201
00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:31.090
Simon Wang: Okay, so this time, I gave the 3 links to the AI agent.

202
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:39.210
Simon Wang: And they said, start visiting these links, and go deeper and deeper, try to visit as many links as possible.

203
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.969
Simon Wang: To explore how the data is tapped in the websites.

204
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:49.519
Simon Wang: Alright? And try to get the overall structure of the pages, and retrieve metadata, and find out what data is available.

205
00:24:49.740 --> 00:25:07.509
Simon Wang: Create a datareport.md to document what you find out and explore how we might answer the questions, how different info sources on land code discussion matters are connected. We want to understand the current practices of creating info and data and consider how they can be improved for the general public.

206
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:14.570
Simon Wang: So, just to, you know, we can, we can start a new conversation.

207
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.860
Simon Wang: And we can send… this over.

208
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:30.279
Simon Wang: to agent, and then they will start visiting all the websites. Now, depending on,

209
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:36.359
Simon Wang: whether there's any kind of, what do we call this? Anti-web crawler thing?

210
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.949
Simon Wang: Hopefully,

211
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:47.739
Simon Wang: we will be able to find something. But, you know, if it doesn't work, then we have to try different tools. There are different tools available.

212
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.040
Simon Wang: But the idea is that,

213
00:25:50.630 --> 00:26:02.570
Simon Wang: you don't have to go to this website anymore. You know, you can ask the agent to get all the data and pages and everything for you, and start doing analysis.

214
00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:14.160
Simon Wang: And, they, they would even, explore the API documents for, for us.

215
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:34.689
Simon Wang: So I hope you can see the potential of this technology, not just for this course, but for, you know.

216
00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.760
Simon Wang: Any other courses that you are… Studying.

217
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.580
Simon Wang: So… Jalen.

218
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.610
Simon Wang: Where's Jalen? What do you think?

219
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.510
Simon Wang: Does it make sense to you?

220
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.409
Simon Wang: Yeah, actually, I… I think the…

221
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.939
Simon Wang: I know what she doesn't mean, but actually, I…

222
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.679
Simon Wang: Always not use this function in… using AI.

223
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:58.579
Simon Wang: Okay, I think at this point, I'm not asking you whether you will use it, but more about whether you understand what we're trying to do here. Yeah, just to analyze the data, right? You want to ask the AI to analyze. So, essentially, we are trying to put some information or instruction here.

224
00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:05.460
Simon Wang: Okay, but not… not in the chat interface. So, again, you can always do the same thing.

225
00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:16.740
Simon Wang: with… You know, I think the benchmarking The benchmarking is always, like… Start.

226
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.550
Simon Wang: a new chat.

227
00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:25.690
Simon Wang: with ChatGBT… or… Any other… oops.

228
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.129
Simon Wang: It's always here, right?

229
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.519
Simon Wang: And, and you can see what… ChatGPT 4.1, or any other…

230
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.619
Simon Wang: Chabot can do it for you.

231
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:55.410
Simon Wang: I mean… This chapel can also do a little bit of things for you.

232
00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:03.119
Simon Wang: But… Whatever… That this chapel is doing for us.

233
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.970
Simon Wang: the AI agent can do a… bad hijab.

234
00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:15.019
Simon Wang: Okay, so that's… But anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt you, so what do you have in mind?

235
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:25.280
Simon Wang: It's very interesting to know this AI engineer, my first time to know this AI engine. Actually, in real life, I just use…

236
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:32.610
Simon Wang: AI, like ChatGPT or Doubao, if you're in Chinese, it's much easier to…

237
00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.610
Simon Wang: gets the answer I want.

238
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.850
Simon Wang: Well,

239
00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:50.389
Simon Wang: I think you might want to give it a shot, okay? It's, I think the steps are not as difficult as you may get the impression, you see what I mean?

240
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.290
Simon Wang: I understand. Right.

241
00:29:52.800 --> 00:30:01.359
Simon Wang: Okay, anyway, so you see, this is the… the report, okay? Thank you. This is a data report we got.

242
00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:12.900
Simon Wang: It, looking at the three primary data access points, that's native console database, the open data, and then there's the data.gov.hk.

243
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:22.660
Simon Wang: So there's the library collection, the library databases, Subscribed, databases.

244
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:30.239
Simon Wang: Archival Holdings, and it is voting results data.

245
00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:34.120
Simon Wang: There's the voting results… Api?

246
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:40.810
Simon Wang: Okay, and then there's the data.gov.hk, so everything has been more or less retrieved.

247
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:55.440
Simon Wang: So the current data flow map is also, Generated… Collect… connection points… gaps in connectivity, strengths, weaknesses.

248
00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:01.200
Simon Wang: stack analysis… Recommendations?

249
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:06.520
Simon Wang: So, for Group 1, Is this a good starting point?

250
00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.999
Simon Wang: Is that me?

251
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:16.790
Simon Wang: So, do you want to pass the mic over… what's your name?

252
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:21.790
Simon Wang: So what do you think? Because I thought you raised your hand, you used the… yeah, just you, you.

253
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:35.000
Simon Wang: Yeah. So you used the cursor before, right? I use Copilot. Copilot. Not Cursor. I've tried it, though. Copilot Agent, right? Just like what I'm using now. So what do you think? What do you think about my demo?

254
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:43.380
Simon Wang: It was good, I think that, like, students probably won't be working with that large, a… a…

255
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:51.210
Simon Wang: text-based, because if students were doing research, they should probably just use Notebook LM. Right.

256
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.129
Simon Wang: So I think use case can kind of get very, like, niche.

257
00:31:54.590 --> 00:32:03.250
Simon Wang: But… Because I think, chatbots are probably more than enough for undergraduates, but if, like…

258
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:16.069
Simon Wang: you know, if you're someone like me, you or me, who knows… who's pretty familiar with, AI agents, you can, like, cut the time… you can cut project time in half, right? So it's hard to pitch to students, like.

259
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:24.789
Simon Wang: value here, but there's also a learning curve. Right. But once you do, you know, have access to that, you can, like, pretty much…

260
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.280
Simon Wang: Operate as, like, 8 people, you know, at the speed of, like, a huge team.

261
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.859
Simon Wang: But I just don't think projects get that big, you know?

262
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:40.019
Simon Wang: At least as… at least as an American student, you know, American projects, maybe I'm… I don't know enough.

263
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:50.860
Simon Wang: about education here, I've already had some culture shocks, but I don't think… I don't think it gets that difficult for, college coursework in the USA, at least. Right.

264
00:32:52.090 --> 00:33:00.179
Simon Wang: Speaking of learning curve, I'm sure that that's… That's a major obstacle, right?

265
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:07.250
Simon Wang: But… but as you can see, for Group 1, for students from Group 1, you know, just a couple of…

266
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:13.729
Simon Wang: You know, type a few words and links and everything, you see, this project is 30% down.

267
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.110
Simon Wang: You see what I mean? You got this project, you know, it's a semester-long project.

268
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:24.640
Simon Wang: But we're talking about, like, 10 minutes. You gotta… Got a pretty nice,

269
00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.630
Simon Wang: Foundation. I mean, I can do the same for all the other teams.

270
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.140
Simon Wang: I mean, this is… this is actually bad news for you guys.

271
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.539
Simon Wang: Because a lot of companies are cutting headcounts for junior positions.

272
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.499
Simon Wang: For fresh grads.

273
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.260
Simon Wang: Because, you see, for Group 1, if you want to get to this point, how many hours do you need?

274
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:57.340
Simon Wang: Took you, like, 5 minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Not me, AI. Anyone who use AI.

275
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.760
Simon Wang: So that's pretty serious.

276
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:04.579
Simon Wang: So how can you still get a job?

277
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:10.900
Simon Wang: with AI Agent on board in a company, you learn how to use AI Agent!

278
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.310
Simon Wang: You see what I mean?

279
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:18.799
Simon Wang: I mean, if you spend an hour or so, you will be able to do exactly the same thing, just like what I did.

280
00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:23.090
Simon Wang: Then you will be… become more competitive in the job market.

281
00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:30.779
Simon Wang: So my argument would be, yes, of course, there's a steep learning curve. Of course, everybody will be scared, intimidated.

282
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.999
Simon Wang: By this. But that's not even an option!

283
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.769
Simon Wang: No, it's not an option, everybody have to start using this.

284
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.070
Simon Wang: Seriously.

285
00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.749
Simon Wang: So I don't agree with you.

286
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.819
Simon Wang: I don't think this is an option.

287
00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:46.900
Simon Wang: Everybody should learn this.

288
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:49.230
Simon Wang: Okay.

289
00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:50.909
Simon Wang: And it's not that hard.

290
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.009
Simon Wang: It's not that hard.

291
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:57.559
Simon Wang: Because… All you have to do is just…

292
00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.179
Simon Wang: I think the only thing that's hard is to…

293
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.750
Simon Wang: Learn to get this fire pass.

294
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.120
Simon Wang: That's the only thing.

295
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.900
Simon Wang: That's the only thing… probably new.

296
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:12.820
Simon Wang: Everything else, you just type. As long as you can type, you… no.

297
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.090
Simon Wang: Okay.

298
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.789
Simon Wang: But anyway,

299
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:25.469
Simon Wang: I don't necessarily, will get a lot of support, you know? Even among my colleagues.

300
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:35.809
Simon Wang: they don't necessarily would appreciate this kind of thing. Well, people get… people get pretty, intimidated when they look at this unfamiliar user interface.

301
00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.880
Simon Wang: But, if you… if you look at it over and over again, you will see…

302
00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.120
Simon Wang: It's not that hard.

303
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.580
Simon Wang: Okay? It's not that hard.

304
00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:51.049
Simon Wang: But anyway, I will share this with you.

305
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:59.460
Simon Wang: I mean, even if you don't want to learn to use… do this, I can still share some document with you, so you can start.

306
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.660
Simon Wang: doing…

307
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:10.640
Simon Wang: things on top of that. And also, whenever you write something on your Google Docs, my agent will read it.

308
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.890
Simon Wang: Okay?

309
00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.859
Simon Wang: So, actually, I will know what you have done.

310
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:19.109
Simon Wang: through, AI agent, and AI agent will start picking things up.

311
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:25.020
Simon Wang: And then you can come here to look at any updates, or any, you know, feedback, or whatever.

312
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:30.520
Simon Wang: But again, the most challenging thing, actually, is to bring more people on board.

313
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.259
Simon Wang: Is that me?

314
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:38.220
Simon Wang: But I understand your reasoning. Thanks for your feedback.

315
00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.050
Simon Wang: Maybe someone else. We got other computer science majors here.

316
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.729
Simon Wang: Do you have something?

317
00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:45.580
Simon Wang: No?

318
00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.409
Simon Wang: Hey, what is Hayden?

319
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.040
Simon Wang: Yeah. What do you think?

320
00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.750
Simon Wang: And think.

321
00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:01.470
Simon Wang: It's quite useful, because… You don't just chat with the chatbot.

322
00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.199
Simon Wang: And, like, ChatGPT, for example.

323
00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:10.150
Simon Wang: It doesn't… We can't create new stuff for you.

324
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.390
Simon Wang: Like, for example, right now, the agent, you just… you just created it, like…

325
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.989
Simon Wang: hours of work, maybe weeks, months of work for EULA in 10 minutes. Right.

326
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.770
Simon Wang: So, actually, it's not that hard. Yeah.

327
00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.280
Simon Wang: I started using it.

328
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:31.140
Simon Wang: Last summer, and… actually just use it like a normal chatbot. Great.

329
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.110
Simon Wang: And…

330
00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:41.300
Simon Wang: If you want to learn how to use it, you don't just chat with it, you need to also read what it… what the output… Yeah, exactly.

331
00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:47.850
Simon Wang: I think you made a very good point. This is something I didn't emphasize well enough.

332
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.770
Simon Wang: Because this whole document can be…

333
00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.690
Simon Wang: There could be a lot of mistakes.

334
00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:55.040
Simon Wang: hallucination.

335
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.350
Simon Wang: You see what I mean? It could be misleading.

336
00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:00.729
Simon Wang: So you can't just take this and send it to your teacher.

337
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.949
Simon Wang: You have to read it, you have to really kind of start reading it, and see whether these things make sense.

338
00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:12.220
Simon Wang: Okay? But my question for Hayden, when we're talking about this, is can we turn this into MCP?

339
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:21.219
Simon Wang: wrap it into a tool, then I don't even need to write a prompt, you see what I mean? You know, just one line command.

340
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.230
Simon Wang: And then, it's all done.

341
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:33.939
Simon Wang: So that's our project, you see what I mean? If we can wrap some standardized workflow into some kind of MCP, and then make it available.

342
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.009
Simon Wang: like, lawmakers, right?

343
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.149
Simon Wang: So that's the… that's the next thing we wanted to explore.

344
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.810
Simon Wang: Because I don't really know much about MCP.

345
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.320
Simon Wang: Okay, so we kind of need to work on this.

346
00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:56.950
Simon Wang: But anyway, I know that, sorry, it's the name of the… Girl from the journalism.

347
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:03.080
Simon Wang: You… Can you… Do you want to talk a little bit about Yeah.

348
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:10.890
Simon Wang: I think this is very helpful for journalists, because

349
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:30.800
Simon Wang: Nowadays, we would like to use more immersive way to tell the story. So, we will use this AI agent to create websites for our news, and, make our news more, like, fancy, more interactive.

350
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:33.909
Simon Wang: I think this is good for, like.

351
00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.400
Simon Wang: gets, our audience's attention. Yeah.

352
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:48.220
Simon Wang: Speaking of that… Let's, ask.

353
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:52.550
Simon Wang: them to create a visually appealing interactive HTML file.

354
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.290
Simon Wang: Based on the report.

355
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.410
Simon Wang: Which is also pretty nice.

356
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:09.370
Simon Wang: Yeah, so I think that's actually something I will do. I will… I would run a demo for journalism students.

357
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:17.629
Simon Wang: Cause, you know, there's that, AI for use.

358
00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.459
Simon Wang: Yeah, so… so that would be something we can…

359
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:35.930
Simon Wang: talk more about. Great! So, what I will be doing, after today's class is to set up similar reports.

360
00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.380
Simon Wang: And things for each team.

361
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:41.520
Simon Wang: Okay? And, you can at least…

362
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:45.210
Simon Wang: you know, start reading some of the stuff that I put here.

363
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:53.959
Simon Wang: And you can think about this a little bit more. I promise you, if you spend only 30 minutes, you should be able to… be able to do this.

364
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.979
Simon Wang: Okay, so 30 minutes of your time.

365
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.360
Simon Wang: It can become saving 20 hours.

366
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:06.679
Simon Wang: Down the road, so… So hopefully that's, good enough pitch.

367
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.050
Simon Wang: To bring you on board.

368
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:19.560
Simon Wang: Let me see if we can get this result. Well, it takes a little while, so… so hopefully there will be an HTML file to see.

369
00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:32.000
Simon Wang: But, see, I… I would say… It becomes more important

370
00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:35.750
Simon Wang: To learn to write the prompts, right?

371
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.789
Simon Wang: So… so this… this piece of document would be super important.

372
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.640
Simon Wang: Of course, you have to find the links.

373
00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:51.830
Simon Wang: Right? If you don't know the links, you don't know where to find the data, then it won't work. So, the links are important.

374
00:41:52.150 --> 00:42:00.380
Simon Wang: And then you need to tell the agent to go to the links to visit, but you see some of the wording I said, like, go deeper…

375
00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:08.699
Simon Wang: you know, get the overall structure of the pages, retrieve metadata. So these are some of the instructions that you need to learn to write.

376
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:19.410
Simon Wang: And once you got this instruction written appropriately, correctly, all you have to do is send the file pass over to the agent, and the agent will take care of the rest.

377
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:24.500
Simon Wang: Alright. But then, of course, you need to…

378
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.070
Simon Wang: You need to apply for the education benefits so you will have access to these tokens for free.

379
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.260
Simon Wang: Because these tokens are actually, costly.

380
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:38.270
Simon Wang: Okay, so you need to have access to these resources.

381
00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:46.399
Simon Wang: But other than that, I can't imagine… How, anyone couldn't…

382
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:55.770
Simon Wang: Get it, you know, start doing this, or start… Learning this, in just about… An hour or so.

383
00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:01.499
Simon Wang: Okay, so we got, HTML.

384
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.450
Simon Wang: Let's take a look.

385
00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.860
Simon Wang: So you won't be disappointed.

386
00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.070
Simon Wang: It's, nice.

387
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:15.149
Simon Wang: Website… We got all the database.

388
00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:18.470
Simon Wang: Open data connection analysis.

389
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.989
Simon Wang: So again, it's for Group 1, right? And you can…

390
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.670
Simon Wang: built something.

391
00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:37.530
Simon Wang: Based on this, Okay, so, if you are working on an online code space, always remember to commit.

392
00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:42.910
Simon Wang: and push… to GitHub.

393
00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:48.080
Simon Wang: And I don't even have to type the commands.

394
00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:01.240
Simon Wang: And then you can come back to… this page…

395
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:24.820
Simon Wang: So now you can see… in, wait.

396
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.910
Simon Wang: But what about the other groups?

397
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.349
Simon Wang: I think the other group should also be here, right?

398
00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:39.830
Simon Wang: Anyway… So, I hope that makes sense, and

399
00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:45.770
Simon Wang: please continue working on the project, and I'll, you know.

400
00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:49.439
Simon Wang: Everybody got a project, you know, got a team to work on.

401
00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:55.530
Simon Wang: And I will, use agent to help you a bit, so to get something done.

402
00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.380
Simon Wang: Going, started.

403
00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:06.409
Simon Wang: And you guys can, you know, continue working on this. Maybe you want to set up a… you know, it's optional, but, you probably only set up a WhatsApp group.

404
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.460
Simon Wang: Invite me or not, it doesn't really matter, but you start working on it.

405
00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:16.439
Simon Wang: And, next week, we will talk about, requesting information from the government.

406
00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.160
Simon Wang: See you next week.
